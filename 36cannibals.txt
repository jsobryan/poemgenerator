left from right, now has the family in his sight Trying to perceive if he's blind or insane, he steers his car into the other lane Both of them collide, expressions horrified Head on at full speed, the vultures will soon feed The father of three was impaled on the wheel, as his skull became a part of the dash His eyeballs ejected his sight uneffected, he saw his own organs collapse His seatbelt was useless for holding him back, it simply cut him in two Legs were crushed, out leaked pus as his spinal cord took off and flew The mother took flight through the glass, and ended up impaled on a sign Her intestines stretched from the car down the road for a quarter of a mile Fourth child on the way, wonot live another day Fetus on the road, with mangled little bones Little children fly, not a chance to wonder why Smashed against the ceiling, all their skin burning and peeling Shards of glass explode, chest and skull now implode Corpses they've become, and graves will have to be dug Underneath the wheels, burning rubber on your face Bleeding from your eyes, the slaughtered victims lies Knowing what he's done, he just backs up one more time Laughing at the mess, a pile of meat on the street One child left slowly dying now, arteries gushing blood Now it's time to feed on flesh, the gore has just begun Early hours, open road, family of five on their way home Having enjoyed a day in the sun, their encounter with gore has just begun A homicidal fool not knowing left from right, now has the family in his sight Trying to perceive if he's blind or insane, he steers his car into

turning red Vile surgeon, knife cutting in Skull cracking, to expose your brain Evil doctor death drove him insane Enter the crypts of hell, to impregnate the dead Fresh burial sight, my hunger grows tonight Undying lust for cadaverous molestation Sights of death building my sensations Ferocious need for decomposing bodies Sex with the dead now I must breed Within the stiff corpse planting my seed The taste of formaldehyde, smell of the rot Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch Raging fires of hell, burning through my soul My love for a dead fuck, I cannot control The child soon will rise, all evil will survive Birth through death The newborn needs a feast, its mother is the meal Chomping on her flesh, his teeth tearing her skin I love to fuck the dead, demons in my head Tearing at my brain Bleeding sores beginning to stench While you lick the festering stump Green infection discharging pus Devour the putrid afterbirth Sex with the dead now I must breed Within the stiff corpse planting my seed The taste of formaldehyde, smell of the rot Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch A quivering pile of useless flesh, locked in a padded cell Hidden from the prying eyes of curiosity Experimental surgery made him what he is today His head is rotting but his body lives on as a worthless vegetable Unknown to mankind, the incredible power of his mind Hideous heredity, genetic imbalance, resorting to cannibalism A feast begins as the patient's skull is cracked open like a walnut Brains devoured in a frenzied slaughter, thrist for gore nothing more Bile is dripping, pus from wounds, as the coroner drinks it down The sights before your eyes you canot describe A trip through this living hell will rot away your skull Genital lacerating, anal asyphyxiation Blockade of bowel passage, defåcation, hemmorage Cadaverous mutilation, metamorphial radiation Devourance of arteries, decapitated extremeties Cranial excavation, cerebral liquidation Brain turned to soup, ears are dripping goop Slimy, cozing, dripping pus, torn out fingernails starting to fuse Shredded cartilage victim lies, eye sockets, but no eyes Miles of intestines strewn all about, facial features strickened with gout Hanging bodies dripping with blood, the blackened fluid sinks in the mud Undead feast, as they tear upon your weak flesh Terror builds, at the thought of being dead Prophecy of the wisemen of old Now comes true, as the corpses break the soil Ancient spell breaks the sleep of the dead The dead awake, what the populace is fearing Panic strikes as the nations run in fear Oceans boil with blood of human victims Suicide, the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead Grave yards coming alive with zombies, hungry for living flesh Psychotic, transmutated corpses, upsuring the population Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us Tables turn as a victim I've become now State of death only waiting to return Vital signs that show I'm dead This canot happen, I'm rising from my own grave Hunger grows not nutritional but instinctual Flesh becomes my only crave of this live Unthinking state, a state of metamorphisis Seeking food to keep me dead Degenerate, a product of man's frustration for his terror Insatiable hunger for mankind, building with each kill Seeking human victims to meet my fill Cannibal I've become, what's happened to my brain Feast on the corpse, suck out his brain As its fluids drip down the drain Chew on the bones, drink from its bladder The vile stench only makes me madder In through the mouth, out the forehead Brains fall out, skin turns red Violent surge, a spear through the skull Felt the urge, now my heart's full I crave gore, I will eat your guts I love gore, blood drives me nuts I drink blood, I do not like water Intestines my cud, I feast in the slaughter Twist its neck, make it crack Suicide, the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead Grave yards coming alive with zombies, hungry for living flesh Psychotic, transmutated corpses, upsuring the population Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us Blood I want to drink, I want to suck Brains I want to eat, the rest I will chuck Bones into a spear, I will carve and kill Hunger for the quest, I will never fill I crave gore, I will eat your guts Walking down the street, the smell of death in the air What a rotting stench My imagination runs wild at what this could be Open up the can to discover a dead body Or what was left of one, pieces in a bag Blood is everywhere what a retched sight Cut up really small by a razor sharp knife Lying in the garbage no one else knows What I have found, what should I do Take it to the police or make it into stew This was an evil committed by the insane Looking down laughing, I am the same The sight of death drives me nuts, I must kill, to control my brain Swept away by my lust to cause pain, mutilation is my only want The evil inside me gives me the strength to kill at will My life is the means to cause death in the most sinister ways I see it in your eyes the fear that keeps me alive I will take it away, your life will end today I will leave you to rot, what a sick odor Scream all you want, but you canot stop this horror Tasting your life as I drink your blood Ripping out your insides, chewing on your spleen Dead or living flesh is what I crave I will kill someone or eat from a grave Lying there cold after a torturous death Your life ended fast you took your last breath Dead in a grave, your final place The maggots infest your disfigured face Pus through your veins takes the place of blood Decay sets in, bones begin to crack Thrown six feet down left to rot Brains oozing black down the side of your broken neck Skull full of maggots They enter your tomb maggots beginning to feast maggots Crawling on you maggots now they eat you maggots Rotting maggots maggots infesting your corpse maggots Parasites of the dead maggots now dwell in your head Lying there cold after a torturous death Your life ended fast you took your last breath Dead in a grave, your final place The maggots infest your disfigured face Pus through your veins takes the place of blood Decay sets in, bones begin to crack Thrown six feet down left to rot Brains oozing black down the side of your broken neck To kill, is why I live My God, gives eternal life Slice you, I watch your blood flow Rotten brains, I feed 'till I'm full Pressure building, the body starts to swell The souls of my victims brings me great power Feasting on flesh by the hour Lungs explode as I cave in your chest Probing through your organs searching for meat Chewing the heart of my kill builds by evil will Bodies emptied of blood to fill my sacrificial chalice I stalk my prey at night, I need to kill tonight To strengthen my evil soul, those that I kill worship me below I am your worst reality, pain and torture of humanity Violent ways of insanity, there is no end to this cruelty In my grasp, I will kill you fast, I will send your soul to hell Butchery of Human beings is the only life I know My armies of zombies will inherit the earth, and answer to my spells Mutilated the human race in search for immortals I drag the carcass home, it feels stiff and cold Incantation of the devil to rob it of its soul Consume the lifeless cadaver, I drink your blackened blood Its death flows through my body, indulge in its pain Crucifixion in the cemetery, awakes the dead from their sleep Rising from their graves, to devour the weakened mortals Under my control, I own their tortured souls Butchery, my meat hooks sharpened to penetrate Emasculate, gouging crotches I will eat Hung upside down, holes punctured through half chewed gristle, Debauchery with dead bodies, turning green Upheaval of human entrails Deterioration of grated genitals Dangling from the hooks Obscene feelings deep inside me Dislocating, separating a blood-drenched body Begin the anal grouting Awaiting insertion To rip out intestine Bodily destruction Vulgar molestation Treachery, never ending soul ripping Lifeless bodies rot, petrified Clogging veins, pressure building Scabbing clotted sores dehydrate Condemned to life of obscurity Dismal dimensions of my being I explore my thoughts through murder Devoting my life to mutilation Screams of blood saturate Grubs feed on dilapidated stumps Darkness overshadowing...

wide open, Bloated organs burst Nerves uprooted, Reopening healed wounds On my body Sucking on the sores Ingesting my own fluids Self-parasitic puss indulgement Grotesque, crippled, carved up carcass Evil controlling my mind, The fear of dying expired of life, To vomit the soul I am dead within my self The end a beginning to a new life in hell I am your path to ever-lasting pain Mass extinction of the human population Son of the devil the evil incarnation Maniacal mass murderer mutilating mortals, The child born unto evil, Trapped within the statue of flesh Vipers travel through bodily orifices, Blessed by the devil Under inverted crosses, Religious ways, Lies controlling minds I walk among mortal beings, but I have died Excavating graves I search for decay Packs of flesh driven zombies ready to feast I suffer forever living only to dismember Open season on humans, Laughing I watch them die, They bleed so easily Their blood flows through my body, I need to taste the flesh Exposing pulsing arteries Removing vital organs Not stopping till you've died Pus from your eyes carnal ways indulge in the gore Slaughtered you lie in a pile of warm guts Constricted corpuscles coagulating Blood my drug a slave to its taste, Reincarnated to human form, Creating a race of immortal beings, Rot away Dead bodies, set a flame Searing flesh, broken necks You canot kill what's

among mortal beings, but I have died Excavating graves Desolate Empty hollow corpse, Desecrate Forced to eat your flesh Extracting purity Violate Twisted bodies rot away Birth is always painful Decaying in the womb Trapped within this body A bleeding human tomb Gutted bitch lies dead Emptied of the child Chewing on the cords Its life line to this world Afterbirth is flowing The stench is overwhelming My body, growing stronger My pain turns to torture Severing its bloodline A butchered infant carcass Meat from the unborn The freshest kills Chopped up children Bathing in blood Contorted and festering I rot in disgust Re-generation of my body Mother ripped apart Smashing in her face My knife cutting holes Fucking her remains Esophagus carved out Crushing cartilage Bile oozing from Punctures in your liver Ripping meat within Chewing on intestine Bladder spurting urine Sight of defecation Now grow infection The child ripped to shreds Drinking its excretions Zombification Ejaculation over mutilation On the mother's body hacked into pieces The sludges from my cock give her life once again Sewing the remains of the child deep within her Reborn through evil My torture known throughout Hell Heed to his calling The demons await my next kill Carnage is my fetish Body cavities scraped of guts Brains seeping from cracks As my axe continues to hack Torsos hang from their own intestines Raped of all bodily extensions, Stumps wreathing in sludge like infection Suffering through a Rancid amputation A pulsating artery accompanied by some veins, Slit with no restraint Sacs of pus develop My muscles tighten as I feel the rush I look at your body starting to gush I slice through the limb, a human dissection Portions of half-eaten flesh in my mouth Starting to chew your now bleeding stump I will swallow your pus Your own rectal slime I will force you to drink Vessels explode as needles injected Uncontrollable, my brain tormented Slit from head to toe, die through the torture Disease engulfs you, internal rot Fresh cut wounds, beginning to clot Ripping through flesh is what I do best Tear off an arm, amputated neck Eyes removed, cranium smashed Decomposing remains, severed in half Dying slowly never to rest, Nerves are quivering as I rip Removal of life on the blade of my knife Inserted in your spine, smashing through bone Feel my hell, I feed on fright Rape the limbless cadaver Rotting alive Tearing my way through the meat Driven to kill, My brain twitching for guts Devoted to evil Severed arteries gush Hungry for the blood Life is to decay Victims meet my blade, carving out organs A world of pain and terror Visions of the future Premonition of the evil, Forthcoming eve of darkness The chosen one will come Eyes torn out, bodies cut in half Twisted corpses hang from broken necks Demented madman, unholy rampage Impaled cranium beginning to drain Sodomize the carcass, chew the anal rot Sewn within the body the dark becomes my light Live inside the shell, feed upon infection At one with the dead I rip my way through easy prey, Disfigured bodies decompose Chewed limbs drip with pus, Intestinal strangulation Humans left ripped apart Lap up the dripping goo Wretched chunks of bleeding flesh Internally you rot away My need to kill induced by hate, Betrayal of trusted ones My mark left on this earth, Victims of my slaughter Souls of my dead, murdered by my hand Blood on my face, innards decay Snapping necks chewing flesh Insatiable thirst for blood Slicing throats viciously Uncontrollable insanity Tear out the beating heart Engulf the quivering spleen, Chew the meat Death is my life Life is to decay victims Meet my blade carving out organs, A world of pain and terror, Visions of the future Premonition of the evil Forthcoming, eve of darkness Eyes torn out bodies cut in half Twisted corpses hang from broken necks, Demented madman, unholy rampage Impaled cranium beginning to drain. There's something inside me It's, it's coming out I feel like killing you Let loose of the anger, held back too long My blood runs cold Through my anatomy, dwells another being Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding Brutality now becomes my appetite Violence is now a way of life The sledge's my tool to torture As it pounds down on your forehead Eyes bulging from their sockets With every swing of my mallet I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in through the cracks, blood does leak distorted beauty, catastrophe Steaming slop, splattered all over me Lifeless body, slouching dead Lecherous abcess, where you once had a head Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust You will never live again, soon your life will end I will see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half Crushing, cranial, contents Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions Suffer, and then you die Torture, pulverized At one with my sixth sense, I feel free To kill as I please, no one can stop me Created to kill, the carnage continues Violently reshaping human facial tissue Brutality becomes my appetite Violence is now a way of life The sledge's my tool to torture As it pounds down on your forehead I do not know I just took that knife And I cut her from her neck Down to anus And I cut out the vagina And I ate it A relapse of my body Sends my mind into multiple seizures Psychologically a new human being One that has never been Cursed by the shamen his voodoo spell has my soul My limbs go numb I canot control my own thought Are his now his evil consuming me ever telling me begin the clit carving Slowly turning me, into a flesh eating zombie Knowing this spell can only be broken by the vaginal skins of young women I proceed to find the meat their bleeding cunts will set me free I canot control my own thought I canot control my own thoughts Warmth seeping from this Body Rotted After I sucked the blood from her ass I feel more alive more alive than I've ever been Even though now I'm dead within My mouth drools As I slice your perinium My body smeared With the guts I've extracted through her hole, came swollen organs cunnilingus with the mutilated My spirit returned from the dead Released by the priest but I felt more real when I was dead The curse is broken I have a dependence on vaginal skin It's become my sexual addiction I must slit, the twitching clit Rotted cavity hold the juice Between the legs, I love to carve My cock is dripping with her blood Swollen with liquid Ready to burst A load of my lymph Will quench this dead body's thirst One month in the grave twisted and half decayed She turned a putrid yellow I pissed in her maggot filled asshole Fucking the rotting My semen is bleeding The smell of decay Seeps from her genital cavity The smell was unbearable As I unburied her I cum blood from my erection I feel it run down her throat, swallow Eyes glassy and vacant body dug up to play with Skin greasy and naked tounguing her rotted anus I need a live woman to fill with my fluid A delicate girl, to mutilate, fuck and kill her body exceptional she thought I was normal but I wanted more I came blood inside of her chocking on the clot gagging on the snot gushing blood, from her mouth bloody gel leaking out Body buried in a shallow grave Unmarked for none to find The sickness I have left behind Undetected go my crimes The greatest thrill of my life To

 Delusions. Delusions are “fixed beliefs that are not amenable to change in light
of conflicting evidence” . This means that despite evidence contradicting
one’s thoughts, the individual is unable to distinguish their thoughts from reality. The inability to
identify thoughts as delusional is likely likely due to a lack of insight. There are a wide range of
delusions that are seen in the schizophrenia related disorders to include:
 Delusions of grandeur- belief they have exceptional abilities, wealth, or fame; belief
they are God or other religious saviors
 Delusions of control- belief that others control their thoughts/feelings/actions
 Delusions of thought broadcasting- belief that one’s thoughts are transparent and
everyone knows what they are thinking
 Delusions of persecution- belief they are going to be harmed, harassed, plotted or
discriminated against by either an individual or an institution; it is the most common
delusion 
 Delusions of reference- belief that specific gestures, comments, or even larger
environmental cues are directed directly to them
 Delusions of thought withdrawal- belief that one’s thoughts have been removed by
another source
It is believed that the presentation of the delusion is primarily related to the social,
emotional, educational, and cultural background of the individual .
For example, an individual with schizophrenia who comes from a highly religious family is more
likely to experience religious delusions  than another type of delusion.
 Hallucinations. Hallucinations can occur in any of the five senses: hearing
, seeing , smelling ,
2nd edition as of 

touching , and tasting . Additionally, they can
occur in a single modality or present across a combination of modalities (e.g., having auditory
and visual hallucinations). For the most part, individuals recognize that their hallucinations are
not real and attempt to engage in normal behavior while simultaneously combating ongoing
hallucinations.
According to various research studies, nearly half of all patients with schizophrenia
report auditory hallucinations, 15% report visual hallucinations, and 5% report tactile
hallucinations . Among the most common types of auditory
hallucinations are voices talking to the patient or various voices talking to one another.
Generally, these hallucinations are not attributable to any one person that the individual knows.
They are usually clear, objective, and definite . Additionally, the
auditory hallucinations can be pleasurable, providing comport to the patient; however, in other
individuals, the auditory hallucinations can be unsettling as they produce commands or malicious
intent.
 Disorganized thinking. Among the most common cognitive impairments
displayed in patients with schizophrenia are disorganized thought, communication, and speech.
More specifically, thoughts and speech patterns may appear to be circumstantial or tangential.
For example, patients may give unnecessary details in response to a question before they finally
produce the desired response. While the question is eventually answered in circumstantial speech
patterns, in tangential speech patterns the patient never reaches the point. Another common
cognitive symptom is speech retardation, where the individual may take a long time before
answering a question. Derailment, or the illogical connection in a chain of thoughts, is another
2nd edition as of 

common type of disorganized thinking. Although not always, derailment is often seen in
illogicality, or the tendency to provide bizarre explanations for things.
These types of distorted thought patterns are often related to concrete thinking. That is,
the individual is focused on one aspect of a concept or thing and neglects all other aspects. This
type of thinking makes treatment difficult as individuals lack insight into their illness and
symptoms .
 Disorganized/Abnormal motor behavior. Psychomotor symptoms can also be
observed in individuals with schizophrenia. These behaviors may manifest as awkward
movements or even ritualistic/repetitive behaviors. They are often unpredictable and
overwhelming, severely impacting their ability to perform daily activities .
 Catatonic behavior. Catatonic behavior, the decreased or complete lack of
reactivity to the environment, is among the most commonly seen disorganized motor behavior in
schizophrenia. There runs a range of catatonic behaviors from negativism (resistance to
instruction); mutism or stupor ; rigidity
; or posturing (holding
odd, awkward postures for long periods; APA, 2013). There is one type of catatonic behavior,
catatonic excitement, where the individual experiences hyperactivity of motor behavior, in a
seemingly excited or delirious way.
 Negative symptoms. Up until this point, all the schizophrenia symptoms can be
categorized as positive symptoms, or symptoms that are an over-exaggeration of normal brain
processes; these symptoms are also new to the individual. The final diagnostic criterion of
schizophrenia is negative symptoms, which are defined as the inability or decreased ability to
initiate actions, speech, express emotion, or feel pleasure . Negative symptoms
2nd edition as of 

often present before positive symptoms and remain once positive symptoms remit. Because of
their prevalence through the course of the disorder, they are also more indicative of prognosis,
with more negative symptoms suggesting a poorer prognosis. The poorer prognosis may be
explained by the lack of effectiveness antipsychotic medications have in addressing negative
symptoms . There are six main types of
negative symptoms seen in patients with schizophrenia. Such symptoms include:
 Affective flattening Reduction in emotional expression; reduced display of
emotional expression
 Alogia Poverty of speech or speech content
 Anhedonia Inability to experience pleasure
 Apathy General lack of interest
 Asociality Lack of interest in social relationships
 Avolition Lack of motivation for goal-directed behavior
 Schizophrenia
As stated above, the hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia include the presentation of at
least two of the following for at least one month: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech,
disorganized/abnormal behavior, or negative symptoms. These symptoms create significant
impairment in an individual’s ability to engage in normal daily functioning such as work, school,
relationships with others, or self-care. It should be noted that the presentation of schizophrenia
varies significantly among individuals, as it is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome .
While the presence of symptoms must persist for a minimum of 6 months to meet the
criteria for a schizophrenia diagnosis, it is not uncommon to have prodromal symptoms that
2nd edition as of 

precede the active phase of the disorder and residual symptoms that follow it. These prodromal
and residual symptoms are “subthreshold” forms of psychotic symptoms that do not cause
significant impairment in functioning, with the exception of negative symptoms Due to the severity of psychotic symptoms, mood disorder symptoms are also
common among individuals with schizophrenia; however, these mood symptoms are distinct
from a mood disorder diagnosis in that psychotic features will exist beyond the remission of
depressive symptoms.
 Schizophreniform Disorder
Schizophreniform disorder is similar to schizophrenia, except for the length of
presentation of symptoms. Schizophreniform disorder is considered an “intermediate” disorder
between schizophrenia and brief psychotic disorder as the symptoms are present for at least one
month but not longer than six months. As you may recall, schizophrenia symptoms must be
present for at least six months; A brief psychotic disorder is diagnosed when symptoms are
present for less than one month. Approximately two-thirds of individuals who are initially
diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder will have symptoms that last longer than six months,
at which time their diagnosis is changed to schizophrenia .
Another key distinguishing feature of schizophreniform disorder is the lack of criteria
related to impaired functioning. While many individuals with schizophreniform disorder do
display impaired functioning, it is not essential for diagnosis. Finally, any major mood
episodes—either depressive or manic— that are present concurrently with the psychotic features
must only be present for a short time, otherwise a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder may be
more appropriate .
2nd edition as of 

 Schizoaffective Disorder
Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by the psychotic symptoms included in
schizophrenia and a concurrent uninterrupted period of a major mood episode—either a
depressive or manic episode. It should be noted that because the loss of interest in pleasurable
activities is a common symptom of schizophrenia, to meet the criteria for a depressive episode
within schizoaffective disorder, the individual must present with a pervasive depressed mood
. While schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder do not have a significant
mood component, schizoaffective disorder requires the presence of a depressive or manic
episode for the majority, if not the total duration of the disorder. While psychotic symptoms are
sometimes present in depressive episodes, they often remit once the depressive episode is
resolved. For individuals with schizoaffective disorder, psychotic symptoms should continue for
at least two weeks in the absence of a major mood disorder . This is the key
distinguishing feature between schizoaffective disorder and major depressive disorder with
psychotic features.
 Delusional Disorder
As suggestive of its title, delusional disorder requires the presence of at least one delusion
that lasts for at least one month in duration. It is important to note that if an individual
experiences hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, or negative
symptoms—in addition to delusions—they should not be diagnosed with delusional disorder as
their symptoms are more aligned with a schizophrenia diagnosis. Unlike most other
schizophrenia-related disorders, daily functioning is not overly impacted due to the delusions.
2nd edition as of 
Additionally, if symptoms of depressive or manic episodes present during delusions, they are
typically brief compared to the duration of the delusions.
The DSM-V  has identified five main subtypes of delusional disorder to
better categorize the symptoms of the individual's disorder. When making a diagnosis of
delusional disorder, one of the following modifiers  is
included. Erotomanic delusion occurs when an individual reports a delusion of another person
being in love with them. Generally speaking, the individual whom the convictions are about is of
higher status, such as a celebrity. Grandiose delusion involves the conviction of having great
talent or insight. Occasionally, patients will report they have made an important discovery that
benefits the general public. Grandiose delusions may also take on religious affiliation, as people
believe they are prophets or even God. Jealous delusion revolves around the conviction that
one’s spouse or partner is/has been unfaithful. While many individuals may have this suspicion
at some point in their relationship, a jealous delusion is much more extensive and generally
based on incorrect inferences that lack evidence. Persecutory delusion involves the individual
believing that they are being conspired against, spied on, followed, poisoned or drugged,
maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in pursuit of their long-term goals .
Of all subtypes of delusional disorder, those experiencing persecutory delusions are the most at
risk of becoming aggressive or hostile, likely due to the persecutory nature of their distorted
beliefs. Finally, somatic delusion involves delusions regarding bodily functions or sensations.
While these delusions can vary significantly, the most common beliefs are that the individual
emits a foul odor despite attempts to rectify the smell; there is an infestation of insects on the
skin; or that they have an internal parasite

One of the most prominent features of schizotypal personality disorder is ideas of
reference, or the belief that unrelated events pertain to them in a particular and unusual way.
Ideas of reference also lead to superstitious behaviors or preoccupation with paranormal
activities that are not generally accepted in their culture . The perception of special
or magical powers, such as the ability to mind-read or control other’s thoughts, has also been
documented in individuals with schizotypal personality disorder. Similar to schizophrenia,
unusual perceptual experiences such as auditory hallucinations, as well as unusual speech
patterns of derailment or incoherence, are also present.
Similar to the other personality disorders within cluster A, there is a component of
paranoia or suspiciousness of other’s motives. Additionally, individuals with schizotypal
personality disorder display inappropriate or restricted affect, thus impacting their ability to
appropriately interact with others in a social context. Significant social anxiety is often also
present in social situations, particularly in those involving unfamiliar people. The combination of
limited affect and social anxiety contributes to their inability to establish and maintain personal
relationships; most individuals with schizotypal personality disorder prefer to keep to themselves
in an effort to reduce this anxiety.
 
1. Antisocial personality disorder. The essential feature of antisocial personality
disorder is the persistent pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others. This
pattern of behavior begins in late childhood or early adolescence and continues throughout
adulthood. While this behavior presents before age 15, the individual cannot be diagnosed with
antisocial personality disorder until the age of 18. Prior to age 18, the individual would be
2nd edition as of 

diagnosed with Conduct Disorder. Although not discussed in this book as it is a disorder of
childhood, conduct disorder involves a repetitive and persistent pattern of behaviors that violate
the rights of others or major age-appropriate norms . Common behaviors of
individuals with conduct disorder that go on to develop antisocial personality disorder are
aggression toward people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, or serious
violation of rules .
While commonly referred to as “psychopaths” or “sociopaths,” individuals with
antisocial personality disorder fail to conform to social norms. This also includes legal rules as
individuals with antisocial personality disorder are often repeatedly arrested for property
destruction, harassing/assaulting others, or stealing . Deceitfulness is another
hallmark symptom of antisocial personality disorder as individuals often lie repeatedly, generally
as a means to gain profit or pleasure. There is also a pattern of impulsivity—decisions made in
the moment without forethought of personal consequences or consideration for others (Lang et
al., 2015). This impulsivity also contributes to their inability to hold jobs as they are more likely
to impulsively quit their jobs . Employment instability, along with
impulsivity, also impacts their ability to manage finances; it is not uncommon to see individuals
with antisocial personality disorder with large debts that they are unable to pay (Derefinko &
Widiger, 2016).
While also likely related to impulsivity, individuals with antisocial personality disorder
tend to be extremely irritable and aggressive, repeatedly getting into fights. The marked
disregard for their safety, as well as the safety of others, is also observed in reckless behavior
such as speeding, driving under the influence, and engaging in sexual and substance abuse
behavior that may put themselves at risk .
2nd edition as of 

Of course, the most known and devastating symptom of antisocial personality disorder is
the lack of remorse for the consequences of their actions, regardless of how severe they may be
. Individuals often rationalize their actions as the fault of the victim, minimize the
harmfulness of the consequences of their behaviors, or display indifference .
Overall, individuals with antisocial personality disorder have limited personal relationships due
to their selfish desire and lack of moral conscience.
2. Borderline personality disorder. Individuals with borderline personality
disorder display a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and
affect . The combination of these symptoms causes significant impairment in
establishing and maintaining personal relationships. They will often go to great lengths to avoid
real or imagined abandonment. Fears related to abandonment often lead to inappropriate anger as
they often interpret the abandonment as a reflection of their own behaviors. It is not uncommon
to experience intense fluctuations in mood, often observed as volatile interactions with family
and friends . Those with borderline personality disorder may be
friendly one day and hostile the next.
In an effort to prevent abandonment, individuals with borderline personality disorder will
often exhibit impulsive behaviors such as self-harm and suicidal behavior. In fact, individuals
with borderline personality disorder engage in more suicide attempts, and completion of suicide
is higher among these individuals than the general public . Other impulsive
behaviors, such as non-suicidal self-injury  and sexual promiscuity, are frequently seen
within this population, typically occurring during high-stress periods (Sansone & Sansone,
2012).
2nd edition as of

Another key characteristic of borderline personality disorder is unstable and intense
relationships. For example, individuals may idealize or experience intense feelings for another
person immediately after meeting them. Occasionally, hallucinations and delusions are present,
particularly of a paranoid nature; however, these symptoms are often transient and recognized as
unacceptable by the individual .
3. Histrionic personality disorder. Histrionic personality disorder is the first
personality disorder that addresses pervasive and excessive emotionality and attention-seeking.
These individuals are usually uncomfortable in social settings unless they are the center of
attention. To help gain attention, the individual is often vivacious and dramatic, using physical
gestures and mannerisms along with grandiose language. These behaviors are initially very
charming to their audience; however, they begin to wear due to the constant need for attention to
be on them. If the theatrical nature does not gain the attention they desire, they may go to great
lengths to draw attention, such as using a fictitious story or creating a dramatic scene (APA,
2013).
To ensure they gain the attention they desire, individuals with histrionic personality
disorder frequently dress and engage in sexually seductive or provocative ways. These sexually
charged behaviors are not only directed at those in which they have a sexual or romantic interest
but to the general public as well . They often spend a significant amount of time on
their physical appearance to gain the attention they desire.
Individuals with histrionic personality disorder are easily suggestible. Their opinions and
feelings are influenced by not only their friends but also by current fads . They also
tend to exaggerate relationships, considering casual acquaintanceships as more intimate than they
are.
2nd edition as of

4. Narcissistic personality disorder. Similar to histrionic personality disorder,
narcissistic personality disorder also centers around the individual; however, with narcissistic
personality disorder, individuals display a pattern of grandiosity along with a lack of empathy for
others . The grandiose sense of self leads to an overvaluation of their abilities and
accomplishments. They often come across as boastful and pretentious, repeatedly proclaiming
their superior achievements. These proclamations may also be fantasized as a means to enhance
their success or power. Oftentimes they identify themselves as “special” and will only interact
with others of high status.
Given the grandiose sense of self, it is not surprising that individuals with narcissistic
personality disorder need excessive admiration from others. While it appears that their self-
esteem is hugely inflated, it is very fragile and dependent on how others perceive them (APA,
2013). Because of this, they may constantly seek out compliments and expect favorable
treatment from others. When this sense of entitlement is not upheld, they can become irritated or
angry that their needs are not met.
A lack of empathy is also displayed in individuals with narcissistic personality disorder
as they often struggle to  recognize the desires or needs of others. This lack of
empathy also leads to exploitation of interpersonal relationships, as they are unable to understand
other’s feelings . They often become envious of others who achieve
greater success or possessions than them. Conversely, they believe everyone should be envious
of their achievements, regardless of how small they may actually be.

1. Avoidant personality disorder. Individuals with avoidant personality disorder
display a pervasive pattern of social anxiety due to feelings of inadequacy and increased
sensitivity to negative evaluations . The fear of being rejected drives their reluctance
to engage in social situations, so that they may prevent others from evaluating them negatively.
This fear extends so far that it prevents individuals from maintaining employment due to their
intense fear of negative evaluation or rejection.
Socially, they have very few if any friends, despite their desire to establish social
relationships. They actively avoid social situations in which they can develop new friendships
out of the fear of being disliked or ridiculed. Similarly, they are cautious of new activities or
relationships as they often exaggerate the potential negative consequences and embarrassment
that may occur; this is likely a result of their ongoing preoccupation with being criticized or
rejected by others.
Despite their view as socially inept, unappealing, or inferior, individuals with avoidant
personality disorder do not typically suffer from social skills deficits, but rather from
misattributions of their behaviors .
2. Dependent personality disorder. Dependent personality disorder is
characterized by pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of by others . This
intense need leads to submissive and clinging behaviors as they fear they will be abandoned or
separated from their parent, spouse, or another person with whom they are in a dependent
relationship. They are so dependent on this other individual that they cannot make even the
smallest decisions without first consulting with them and gaining their approval or reassurance.
They often allow others to assume complete responsibility for their life, making decisions in
2nd edition as of 
3
nearly all aspects of their lives. Rarely will they challenge these decisions as their fear of losing
this relationship greatly outweighs their desire to express their own opinion. Should the
relationship end, the individual experiences significant feelings of helplessness and quickly seeks
out another relationship to replace the old one .
When they are on their own, individuals with dependent personality disorder express
difficulty initiating and engaging in tasks on their own. They lack self-confidence and feel
helpless when they are left to care for themselves or engage in tasks on their own. So that they do
not have to engage in tasks alone, individuals will go to great lengths to seek out support of
others, often volunteering for unpleasant tasks if it means they will get the reassurance they need
.
3. Obsessive-Compulsive personality disorder. OCPD is defined by an
individual’s preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and ability to control situations that
they lose flexibility, openness, and efficiency in everyday life . One’s preoccupation
with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules overshadows the larger picture of the
task or activity. In fact, the need to complete the task or activity is significantly impacted by the
individual’s self-imposed high standards and need to complete the task perfectly, that the task
often does not get completed. The desire to complete the task perfectly often causes the
individual to spend an excessive amount of time on the task, occasionally repeating it until it is to
their standard. Due to repetition and attention to fine detail, the individual often does not have
time to engage in leisure activities or engage in social relationships. Despite the excessive
amount of time spent on activities or tasks, individuals with OCPD will not seek help from
others, as they are convinced that the others are incompetent and will not complete the task up to
their standard.
2nd edition as of 
4
Personally, individuals with OCD are rigid and stubborn, particularly with their morals,
ethics, and values. Not only do they hold these standards for themselves, but they also expect
others to have similarly high standards, thus causing significant disruption to their social
interactions. The rigid and stubborn behaviors are also seen in their financial status, as they are
known to live significantly below their means to prepare financially for a potential catastrophe
. Similarly, they may have difficulty discarding worn-out or worthless items, despite
their lack of sentimental value.
While some argue that OCPD and OCD are one and the same, others believe there is a
distinct difference as the personality disorder lacks definitive obsessions and compulsions (APA,
2013). Although many individuals are diagnosed with both OCD and OCPD, research indicates
that individuals with OCPD are more likely to be diagnosed with major depression, generalized
anxiety disorder, or substance abuse disorder than OCD 
 Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don’t be too particular.

With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The Crossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further on, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t you hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.

Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then must needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.

It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the preacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’

Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”

Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.

It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.

But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost?

Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.

But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.
