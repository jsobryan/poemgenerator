car down the road for a quarter of a mile Fourth child on the way, wonot live another day Fetus on the road, with mangled little bones Little children fly, not a chance to wonder why Smashed against

disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us Tables turn as a victim I've become now State of death only waiting to return Vital signs that show I'm dead This canot happen, I'm rising from my own grave Hunger grows not nutritional but instinctual Flesh becomes my only crave of this live Unthinking state, a state of metamorphisis Seeking food to keep me dead Degenerate, a product of man's frustration for his terror Insatiable hunger for mankind, building with each kill Seeking human victims to meet my fill Cannibal I've become, what's happened to my brain Feast on the corpse, suck out

this could be Open up the can to discover a dead body Or what was left of one, pieces in a bag Blood is everywhere what a retched sight Cut up really small by a razor sharp knife Lying in the garbage no one else knows What I have found, what should I do Take it to the police or make it into stew This was an evil committed by the insane Looking down laughing, I am the same The sight of death drives me nuts, I must kill, to control my brain Swept away by my lust to cause pain, mutilation is my only want The evil inside me gives me the strength to kill at will My life is the means to cause death

limbless cadaver Rotting alive Tearing my way through the meat Driven to kill, My brain twitching for guts Devoted to evil Severed arteries gush Hungry for the blood Life is to decay Victims meet my blade, carving out organs A world of pain and terror Visions of the future Premonition of the evil, Forthcoming eve of darkness The chosen one will come Eyes torn out, bodies cut in half Twisted corpses hang from broken necks Demented madman, unholy rampage Impaled cranium beginning to drain Sodomize the carcass, chew the anal rot Sewn within the body the dark becomes my light Live inside the shell, feed upon infection At one with the dead I rip my way through easy prey, Disfigured bodies decompose Chewed limbs drip with pus, Intestinal strangulation Humans left ripped apart Lap up the dripping goo Wretched chunks of bleeding flesh Internally you rot away My need to kill induced by hate, Betrayal of trusted ones My mark left on this earth, Victims of my slaughter Souls of my dead, murdered by my hand Blood on my face, innards decay Snapping necks chewing flesh Insatiable thirst for blood Slicing throats viciously Uncontrollable insanity Tear out the beating heart Engulf the quivering spleen, Chew the meat Death is my life Life is to decay victims Meet my blade carving out organs, A world of pain and terror, Visions of the future Premonition of the evil Forthcoming, eve of darkness Eyes torn out bodies cut in half Twisted corpses hang from broken necks, Demented madman, unholy rampage Impaled cranium beginning to drain. There's something inside me It's, it's coming out I feel like killing you Let loose of the anger, held back too long My blood runs cold Through my anatomy, dwells another being Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding Brutality now becomes my appetite Violence is now a way of life The sledge's my tool to torture As it pounds down on your forehead Eyes bulging from their sockets With every swing of my mallet I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in through the cracks, blood does leak distorted beauty, catastrophe Steaming slop, splattered all over me Lifeless body, slouching dead Lecherous abcess, where you once had a head Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust You will never live again, soon your life will end I will see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half Crushing, cranial, contents Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions Suffer, and then you die Torture, pulverized At one with my sixth sense, I feel free To kill as I please, no one can stop me Created to kill, the carnage continues Violently reshaping human facial tissue Brutality becomes my appetite Violence is now a way of life The sledge's my tool to torture As it pounds down on your forehead I do not know I just took that knife And I cut her from her neck Down to anus And I cut out the vagina And I ate it A relapse of my body Sends my mind into multiple seizures Psychologically a new human being One that has never been Cursed by the shamen his voodoo spell has my soul My limbs go numb I canot control my own thought Are his now his evil consuming me ever telling me begin the clit carving Slowly turning me, into a flesh eating zombie Knowing this spell can only be broken by the vaginal skins of young women I proceed to find the meat their bleeding cunts will set me free I canot control my own thought I canot control my own thoughts Warmth seeping from this Body Rotted After I sucked the blood from her ass I feel more alive more alive than I've ever been Even though now I'm dead within My mouth drools As I slice your perinium My body smeared With the guts I've extracted through her hole, came swollen organs cunnilingus with the mutilated My spirit returned from the dead Released by the priest but I felt more real when I was dead The curse is broken I have a dependence on vaginal skin It's become my sexual addiction I must slit, the twitching clit Rotted cavity hold the juice Between the legs, I love to carve My cock is dripping with her blood Swollen with liquid Ready to burst A load of my lymph Will quench this dead body's thirst One month in the grave twisted and half decayed She turned a putrid yellow I pissed in her maggot filled asshole Fucking the rotting My semen is bleeding The smell of decay Seeps from her genital cavity The smell was unbearable As I unburied her I cum blood from my erection I feel it run down her throat, swallow Eyes glassy and vacant body dug up to play with Skin greasy and naked tounguing her rotted anus I need a live woman to fill with my fluid A delicate girl, to mutilate, fuck and kill her body exceptional she thought I was normal but I wanted more I came blood inside of her chocking on the clot gagging on the snot gushing blood, from her mouth bloody gel leaking out Body buried in a shallow grave Unmarked for none to find The sickness I have left behind Undetected go my crimes The greatest thrill of my life To slit my own cock with a knife Violent, climax Serging serum on my skin Back from the dead I am resurrected to spew, putrefaction Melting thoughts of disintegration Hitting deep her insistance to mutilate her newborn infants After giving birth her mind wasnot the same Slowly slipping away, a state of mental decay Family now complete Father watches on As mother dismembers her newborn son Dissecting the specimen, split I will explore, the body wide open Uncover carnage within, split wide open Virgin, untouched skin Releasing her rage That dwells inside tainted blood rushes through veins her body chemically changed Love was erased, on the edge of a butcher's knife The kitchen becomes a makeshift slaughterhouse every nine months she butchers one more child Reminders of the deceased, scattered through the home Bones and skulls of sons and daughters Genitals ferment In jars inside the cupboards for father to dissect No one will discover the murder they commit Children used like laboratory rats Sickening vulgar experiments She sees what others canot Probing the guts of her fetus Advocation of the pain Mutilating, draining veins Witness the horror offering to themselves Continuing murdering their own kind Never deny this fantasy life, they enjoy Addiction to this heightened state Post-birth psychosis disjointing her own children form the life they will never live A massacre within her soul Struggling for control I was once a man before I transformed into this molester, freshly deceased children You have born, torn by my rape The dead are not safe, the lifeless child corpse I will violate Pleasure from the dead, complete satisfaction I open the coffin Sick thoughts run through my head as I stare At the dead, over and over, I canot escape I begin the dead sex, licking her young, rotted orifice I cum in her cold cunt, shivering with ecstasy for nine days straight I do the same She becomes by dead, decayed child sex slave her neck I hack, cutting through the back I use her mouth to eject Here I cum, blood gushes from bleeding black blood her head disconnected As I came, viciously I cut, through her jugular vein She's already dead, I masturbate with her severed head My lubrication, her decomposition Spending my life molesting dead children Intercourse with infants Curing heads on top of spikes boiling skulls Skin sliding off of bones Voices The voices call Voices The voices are calling me Buried dead I've spiritually infected Call to me from beyond their graves Bleed I now bleed pus I bleed, the blood of the dead I bleed on her livid skin Thrusting myself within Beginning to chop through her hairless crotch Beyond what we know as death It haunts me everyday I hear the voice of every child That lies next to me decayed A fresh corpse, to fill with my infection Tortured before death, no orifice left unfilled Violated after death Virgin hole I infest Anal pore spewing cess The sacred juice I injest Your dead child I defile Tearing at my neck my sharpened teeth pierce the meat My warm bloodied prey sustains my life for one more day The oldest of souls, left behind after life Before death I was nothing but human Indulgence in the blood, intoxicated from its drug It warms my cold soul Tapping the gushing sap, trickling down my throat Rejuvenation of my body No blood left to scab Now it flows through my veins Heaven I have found Fear in my grip Transcend beyond mortal The sweet blood I will swallow Draining the inner spirit Feasting on the power Knowing only pleasure Human blood I devour Ghastly beauty look into my eyes to reproduce with the living every century Impregnation of the virgin I drink the blood of the unborn Returning to my grave dragging my blood drained prey My body burns from the light Sleeping until night In my clutch, you greet me with open arms soon I will rip them off And drink the blood from the stumps Life and death are too clear but mankind is blind to see the twisted path of their own mortality Scripts of the dead Netherworld knowledge Rotten fragrance lingers Unleash the odor I have risen Vampire Zombie Sucking on Arteries body numbs One of my sons died for your sins Resurrect him so I can drink his blood again Alive alone now that they've gone dead but unburied I've seen it unfold, terrible scenes of agony Eyes in the darkness Echoing their madness The sights that have passed before them Watching as though it has never happened Now I only listen to what is not spoken Murder, hatred Anger, Savage Killings I have caused more than can be counted orgies of sadism And sexual perversion Virgin Tied to my mattress Legs spread wide Ruptured bowel, yanked From her insides Devirginized with my knife Internally bleeding Vagina, secreting her blood-wet pussy I am eating on her guts I am feeding Mutilated with a machete I fucked her dead body The first and last Your life's only romance My knife's jammed in your ass As you die you orgasm Pass on to the dead Nerve trembling convulsions No longer looking human I never see them, but I know they're there Locked in my subconcious Obscene memories I thought I'd forgotten Haunting unrealities Tear at me Hold her arms Her mouth taped shut Screams unheard Out pour her guts Layers of flesh peeling away Languish in your own decay descriptions of my killings bone chilling Terror, tear, her Virgin cunt Virgins are my victims Their tight interiors I explore Sharpened utensils of torture Now inserted inside of her Sex organs extracted for eating On her liver I am gnawing Forbidden lust for guts Ripped from her cunt Tears of blood cry down her thigh I ram my fist inside her hole From her crotch piss now flows Rectum filled with shit I fucked her emptied body Until she became stiff Suffering my only need now is to hang the rope does swing, hanging from the darkened ceiling Strangling, dangling from my twisted spine I knew I would enjoy death more than life My lids close tight, but the light blinds my eyes My body grows cold my cock becomes erect Watching over my dead shell, from beyond in my own hell Caught between life and death, even though my body's dead I still feel the touch of flesh Given the choice to die or live dead Purgatory my damnation Climaxing at the resurrection Adipocere spurts from my erection Manifested in my rotted body Unpure spirit, dead among mortals I have risen from

 Delusions. Delusions are “fixed beliefs that are not amenable to change in light
of conflicting evidence” . This means that despite evidence contradicting
one’s thoughts, the individual is unable to distinguish their thoughts from reality. The inability to
identify thoughts as delusional is likely likely due to a lack of insight. There are a wide range of
delusions that are seen in the schizophrenia related disorders to include:
 Delusions of grandeur- belief they have exceptional abilities, wealth, or fame; belief
they are God or other religious saviors
 Delusions of control- belief that others control their thoughts/feelings/actions
 Delusions of thought broadcasting- belief that one’s thoughts are transparent and
everyone knows what they are thinking
 Delusions of persecution- belief they are going to be harmed, harassed, plotted or
discriminated against by either an individual or an institution; it is the most common
delusion 
 Delusions of reference- belief that specific gestures, comments, or even larger
environmental cues are directed directly to them
 Delusions of thought withdrawal- belief that one’s thoughts have been removed by
another source
It is believed that the presentation of the delusion is primarily related to the social,
emotional, educational, and cultural background of the individual .
For example, an individual with schizophrenia who comes from a highly religious family is more
likely to experience religious delusions  than another type of delusion.
 Hallucinations. Hallucinations can occur in any of the five senses: hearing
, seeing , smelling ,
 edition as of 

touching , and tasting . Additionally, they can
occur in a single modality or present across a combination of modalities (e.g., having auditory
and visual hallucinations). For the most part, individuals recognize that their hallucinations are
not real and attempt to engage in normal behavior while simultaneously combating ongoing
hallucinations.
According to various research studies, nearly half of all patients with schizophrenia
report auditory hallucinations, 15% report visual hallucinations, and 5% report tactile
hallucinations . Among the most common types of auditory
hallucinations are voices talking to the patient or various voices talking to one another.
Generally, these hallucinations are not attributable to any one person that the individual knows.
They are usually clear, objective, and definite . Additionally, the
auditory hallucinations can be pleasurable, providing comport to the patient; however, in other
individuals, the auditory hallucinations can be unsettling as they produce commands or malicious
intent.
 Disorganized thinking. Among the most common cognitive impairments
displayed in patients with schizophrenia are disorganized thought, communication, and speech.
More specifically, thoughts and speech patterns may appear to be circumstantial or tangential.
For example, patients may give unnecessary details in response to a question before they finally
produce the desired response. While the question is eventually answered in circumstantial speech
patterns, in tangential speech patterns the patient never reaches the point. Another common
cognitive symptom is speech retardation, where the individual may take a long time before
answering a question. Derailment, or the illogical connection in a chain of thoughts, is another
 edition as of 

common type of disorganized thinking. Although not always, derailment is often seen in
illogicality, or the tendency to provide bizarre explanations for things.
These types of distorted thought patterns are often related to concrete thinking. That is,
the individual is focused on one aspect of a concept or thing and neglects all other aspects. This
type of thinking makes treatment difficult as individuals lack insight into their illness and
symptoms .
 Disorganized/Abnormal motor behavior. Psychomotor symptoms can also be
observed in individuals with schizophrenia. These behaviors may manifest as awkward
movements or even ritualistic/repetitive behaviors. They are often unpredictable and
overwhelming, severely impacting their ability to perform daily activities .
 Catatonic behavior. Catatonic behavior, the decreased or complete lack of
reactivity to the environment, is among the most commonly seen disorganized motor behavior in
schizophrenia. There runs a range of catatonic behaviors from negativism (resistance to
instruction); mutism or stupor ; rigidity
; or posturing (holding
odd, awkward postures for long periods; APA, 2013). There is one type of catatonic behavior,
catatonic excitement, where the individual experiences hyperactivity of motor behavior, in a
seemingly excited or delirious way.
 Negative symptoms. Up until this point, all the schizophrenia symptoms can be
categorized as positive symptoms, or symptoms that are an over-exaggeration of normal brain
processes; these symptoms are also new to the individual. The final diagnostic criterion of
schizophrenia is negative symptoms, which are defined as the inability or decreased ability to
initiate actions, speech, express emotion, or feel pleasure . Negative symptoms
 edition as of 

often present before positive symptoms and remain once positive symptoms remit. Because of
their prevalence through the course of the disorder, they are also more indicative of prognosis,
with more negative symptoms suggesting a poorer prognosis. The poorer prognosis may be
explained by the lack of effectiveness antipsychotic medications have in addressing negative
symptoms . There are six main types of
negative symptoms seen in patients with schizophrenia. Such symptoms include:
 Affective flattening Reduction in emotional expression; reduced display of
emotional expression
 Alogia Poverty of speech or speech content
 Anhedonia Inability to experience pleasure
 Apathy General lack of interest
 Asociality Lack of interest in social relationships
 Avolition Lack of motivation for goal-directed behavior
 Schizophrenia
As stated above, the hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia include the presentation of at
least two of the following for at least one month: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech,
disorganized/abnormal behavior, or negative symptoms. These symptoms create significant
impairment in an individual’s ability to engage in normal daily functioning such as work, school,
relationships with others, or self-care. It should be noted that the presentation of schizophrenia
varies significantly among individuals, as it is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome .
While the presence of symptoms must persist for a minimum of 6 months to meet the
criteria for a schizophrenia diagnosis, it is not uncommon to have prodromal symptoms that
 edition as of 

precede the active phase of the disorder and residual symptoms that follow it. These prodromal
and residual symptoms are “subthreshold” forms of psychotic symptoms that do not cause
significant impairment in functioning, with the exception of negative symptoms Due to the severity of psychotic symptoms, mood disorder symptoms are also
common among individuals with schizophrenia; however, these mood symptoms are distinct
from a mood disorder diagnosis in that psychotic features will exist beyond the remission of
depressive symptoms.
 Schizophreniform Disorder
Schizophreniform disorder is similar to schizophrenia, except for the length of
presentation of symptoms. Schizophreniform disorder is considered an “intermediate” disorder
between schizophrenia and brief psychotic disorder as the symptoms are present for at least one
month but not longer than six months. As you may recall, schizophrenia symptoms must be
present for at least six months; A brief psychotic disorder is diagnosed when symptoms are
present for less than one month. Approximately two-thirds of individuals who are initially
diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder will have symptoms that last longer than six months,
at which time their diagnosis is changed to schizophrenia .
Another key distinguishing feature of schizophreniform disorder is the lack of criteria
related to impaired functioning. While many individuals with schizophreniform disorder do
display impaired functioning, it is not essential for diagnosis. Finally, any major mood
episodes—either depressive or manic— that are present concurrently with the psychotic features
must only be present for a short time, otherwise a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder may be
more appropriate .
 edition as of 

 Schizoaffective Disorder
Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by the psychotic symptoms included in
schizophrenia and a concurrent uninterrupted period of a major mood episode—either a
depressive or manic episode. It should be noted that because the loss of interest in pleasurable
activities is a common symptom of schizophrenia, to meet the criteria for a depressive episode
within schizoaffective disorder, the individual must present with a pervasive depressed mood
. While schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder do not have a significant
mood component, schizoaffective disorder requires the presence of a depressive or manic
episode for the majority, if not the total duration of the disorder. While psychotic symptoms are
sometimes present in depressive episodes, they often remit once the depressive episode is
resolved. For individuals with schizoaffective disorder, psychotic symptoms should continue for
at least two weeks in the absence of a major mood disorder . This is the key
distinguishing feature between schizoaffective disorder and major depressive disorder with
psychotic features.
 Delusional Disorder
As suggestive of its title, delusional disorder requires the presence of at least one delusion
that lasts for at least one month in duration. It is important to note that if an individual
experiences hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, or negative
symptoms—in addition to delusions—they should not be diagnosed with delusional disorder as
their symptoms are more aligned with a schizophrenia diagnosis. Unlike most other
schizophrenia-related disorders, daily functioning is not overly impacted due to the delusions.
 edition as of 
Additionally, if symptoms of depressive or manic episodes present during delusions, they are
typically brief compared to the duration of the delusions.
The DSM-V  has identified five main subtypes of delusional disorder to
better categorize the symptoms of the individual's disorder. When making a diagnosis of
delusional disorder, one of the following modifiers  is
included. Erotomanic delusion occurs when an individual reports a delusion of another person
being in love with them. Generally speaking, the individual whom the convictions are about is of
higher status, such as a celebrity. Grandiose delusion involves the conviction of having great
talent or insight. Occasionally, patients will report they have made an important discovery that
benefits the general public. Grandiose delusions may also take on religious affiliation, as people
believe they are prophets or even God. Jealous delusion revolves around the conviction that
one’s spouse or partner is/has been unfaithful. While many individuals may have this suspicion
at some point in their relationship, a jealous delusion is much more extensive and generally
based on incorrect inferences that lack evidence. Persecutory delusion involves the individual
believing that they are being conspired against, spied on, followed, poisoned or drugged,
maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in pursuit of their long-term goals .
Of all subtypes of delusional disorder, those experiencing persecutory delusions are the most at
risk of becoming aggressive or hostile, likely due to the persecutory nature of their distorted
beliefs. Finally, somatic delusion involves delusions regarding bodily functions or sensations.
While these delusions can vary significantly, the most common beliefs are that the individual
emits a foul odor despite attempts to rectify the smell; there is an infestation of insects on the
skin; or that they have an internal parasite 

 edition as of 

One of the most prominent features of schizotypal personality disorder is ideas of
reference, or the belief that unrelated events pertain to them in a particular and unusual way.
Ideas of reference also lead to superstitious behaviors or preoccupation with paranormal
activities that are not generally accepted in their culture . The perception of special
or magical powers, such as the ability to mind-read or control other’s thoughts, has also been
documented in individuals with schizotypal personality disorder. Similar to schizophrenia,
unusual perceptual experiences such as auditory hallucinations, as well as unusual speech
patterns of derailment or incoherence, are also present.
Similar to the other personality disorders within cluster A, there is a component of
paranoia or suspiciousness of other’s motives. Additionally, individuals with schizotypal
personality disorder display inappropriate or restricted affect, thus impacting their ability to
appropriately interact with others in a social context. Significant social anxiety is often also
present in social situations, particularly in those involving unfamiliar people. The combination of
limited affect and social anxiety contributes to their inability to establish and maintain personal
relationships; most individuals with schizotypal personality disorder prefer to keep to themselves
in an effort to reduce this anxiety.
 
1. Antisocial personality disorder. The essential feature of antisocial personality
disorder is the persistent pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others. This
pattern of behavior begins in late childhood or early adolescence and continues throughout
adulthood. While this behavior presents before age 15, the individual cannot be diagnosed with
antisocial personality disorder until the age of 18. Prior to age 18, the individual would be
 edition as of 

diagnosed with Conduct Disorder. Although not discussed in this book as it is a disorder of
childhood, conduct disorder involves a repetitive and persistent pattern of behaviors that violate
the rights of others or major age-appropriate norms . Common behaviors of
individuals with conduct disorder that go on to develop antisocial personality disorder are
aggression toward people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, or serious
violation of rules .
While commonly referred to as “psychopaths” or “sociopaths,” individuals with
antisocial personality disorder fail to conform to social norms. This also includes legal rules as
individuals with antisocial personality disorder are often repeatedly arrested for property
destruction, harassing/assaulting others, or stealing . Deceitfulness is another
hallmark symptom of antisocial personality disorder as individuals often lie repeatedly, generally
as a means to gain profit or pleasure. There is also a pattern of impulsivity—decisions made in
the moment without forethought of personal consequences or consideration for others (Lang et
al., 2015). This impulsivity also contributes to their inability to hold jobs as they are more likely
to impulsively quit their jobs . Employment instability, along with
impulsivity, also impacts their ability to manage finances; it is not uncommon to see individuals
with antisocial personality disorder with large debts that they are unable to pay (Derefinko &
Widiger, 2016).
While also likely related to impulsivity, individuals with antisocial personality disorder
tend to be extremely irritable and aggressive, repeatedly getting into fights. The marked
disregard for their safety, as well as the safety of others, is also observed in reckless behavior
such as speeding, driving under the influence, and engaging in sexual and substance abuse
behavior that may put themselves at risk .
 edition as of 

Of course, the most known and devastating symptom of antisocial personality disorder is
the lack of remorse for the consequences of their actions, regardless of how severe they may be
. Individuals often rationalize their actions as the fault of the victim, minimize the
harmfulness of the consequences of their behaviors, or display indifference .
Overall, individuals with antisocial personality disorder have limited personal relationships due
to their selfish desire and lack of moral conscience.
2. Borderline personality disorder. Individuals with borderline personality
disorder display a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and
affect . The combination of these symptoms causes significant impairment in
establishing and maintaining personal relationships. They will often go to great lengths to avoid
real or imagined abandonment. Fears related to abandonment often lead to inappropriate anger as
they often interpret the abandonment as a reflection of their own behaviors. It is not uncommon
to experience intense fluctuations in mood, often observed as volatile interactions with family
and friends . Those with borderline personality disorder may be
friendly one day and hostile the next.
In an effort to prevent abandonment, individuals with borderline personality disorder will
often exhibit impulsive behaviors such as self-harm and suicidal behavior. In fact, individuals
with borderline personality disorder engage in more suicide attempts, and completion of suicide
is higher among these individuals than the general public . Other impulsive
behaviors, such as non-suicidal self-injury  and sexual promiscuity, are frequently seen
within this population, typically occurring during high-stress periods (Sansone & Sansone,
2012).
 edition as of

Another key characteristic of borderline personality disorder is unstable and intense
relationships. For example, individuals may idealize or experience intense feelings for another
person immediately after meeting them. Occasionally, hallucinations and delusions are present,
particularly of a paranoid nature; however, these symptoms are often transient and recognized as
unacceptable by the individual .
3. Histrionic personality disorder. Histrionic personality disorder is the first
personality disorder that addresses pervasive and excessive emotionality and attention-seeking.
These individuals are usually uncomfortable in social settings unless they are the center of
attention. To help gain attention, the individual is often vivacious and dramatic, using physical
gestures and mannerisms along with grandiose language. These behaviors are initially very
charming to their audience; however, they begin to wear due to the constant need for attention to
be on them. If the theatrical nature does not gain the attention they desire, they may go to great
lengths to draw attention, such as using a fictitious story or creating a dramatic scene (APA,
2013).
To ensure they gain the attention they desire, individuals with histrionic personality
disorder frequently dress and engage in sexually seductive or provocative ways. These sexually
charged behaviors are not only directed at those in which they have a sexual or romantic interest
but to the general public as well . They often spend a significant amount of time on
their physical appearance to gain the attention they desire.
Individuals with histrionic personality disorder are easily suggestible. Their opinions and
feelings are influenced by not only their friends but also by current fads . They also
tend to exaggerate relationships, considering casual acquaintanceships as more intimate than they
are.
 edition as of

4. Narcissistic personality disorder. Similar to histrionic personality disorder,
narcissistic personality disorder also centers around the individual; however, with narcissistic
personality disorder, individuals display a pattern of grandiosity along with a lack of empathy for
others . The grandiose sense of self leads to an overvaluation of their abilities and
accomplishments. They often come across as boastful and pretentious, repeatedly proclaiming
their superior achievements. These proclamations may also be fantasized as a means to enhance
their success or power. Oftentimes they identify themselves as “special” and will only interact
with others of high status.
Given the grandiose sense of self, it is not surprising that individuals with narcissistic
personality disorder need excessive admiration from others. While it appears that their self-
esteem is hugely inflated, it is very fragile and dependent on how others perceive them (APA,
2013). Because of this, they may constantly seek out compliments and expect favorable
treatment from others. When this sense of entitlement is not upheld, they can become irritated or
angry that their needs are not met.
A lack of empathy is also displayed in individuals with narcissistic personality disorder
as they often struggle to  recognize the desires or needs of others. This lack of
empathy also leads to exploitation of interpersonal relationships, as they are unable to understand
other’s feelings . They often become envious of others who achieve
greater success or possessions than them. Conversely, they believe everyone should be envious
of their achievements, regardless of how small they may actually be.

1. Avoidant personality disorder. Individuals with avoidant personality disorder
display a pervasive pattern of social anxiety due to feelings of inadequacy and increased
sensitivity to negative evaluations . The fear of being rejected drives their reluctance
to engage in social situations, so that they may prevent others from evaluating them negatively.
This fear extends so far that it prevents individuals from maintaining employment due to their
intense fear of negative evaluation or rejection.
Socially, they have very few if any friends, despite their desire to establish social
relationships. They actively avoid social situations in which they can develop new friendships
out of the fear of being disliked or ridiculed. Similarly, they are cautious of new activities or
relationships as they often exaggerate the potential negative consequences and embarrassment
that may occur; this is likely a result of their ongoing preoccupation with being criticized or
rejected by others.
Despite their view as socially inept, unappealing, or inferior, individuals with avoidant
personality disorder do not typically suffer from social skills deficits, but rather from
misattributions of their behaviors .
2. Dependent personality disorder. Dependent personality disorder is
characterized by pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of by others . This
intense need leads to submissive and clinging behaviors as they fear they will be abandoned or
separated from their parent, spouse, or another person with whom they are in a dependent
relationship. They are so dependent on this other individual that they cannot make even the
smallest decisions without first consulting with them and gaining their approval or reassurance.
They often allow others to assume complete responsibility for their life, making decisions in
 edition as of 
3
nearly all aspects of their lives. Rarely will they challenge these decisions as their fear of losing
this relationship greatly outweighs their desire to express their own opinion. Should the
relationship end, the individual experiences significant feelings of helplessness and quickly seeks
out another relationship to replace the old one .
When they are on their own, individuals with dependent personality disorder express
difficulty initiating and engaging in tasks on their own. They lack self-confidence and feel
helpless when they are left to care for themselves or engage in tasks on their own. So that they do
not have to engage in tasks alone, individuals will go to great lengths to seek out support of
others, often volunteering for unpleasant tasks if it means they will get the reassurance they need
.
3. Obsessive-Compulsive personality disorder. OCPD is defined by an
individual’s preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and ability to control situations that
they lose flexibility, openness, and efficiency in everyday life . One’s preoccupation
with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules overshadows the larger picture of the
task or activity. In fact, the need to complete the task or activity is significantly impacted by the
individual’s self-imposed high standards and need to complete the task perfectly, that the task
often does not get completed. The desire to complete the task perfectly often causes the
individual to spend an excessive amount of time on the task, occasionally repeating it until it is to
their standard. Due to repetition and attention to fine detail, the individual often does not have
time to engage in leisure activities or engage in social relationships. Despite the excessive
amount of time spent on activities or tasks, individuals with OCPD will not seek help from
others, as they are convinced that the others are incompetent and will not complete the task up to
their standard.
 edition as of 
4
Personally, individuals with OCD are rigid and stubborn, particularly with their morals,
ethics, and values. Not only do they hold these standards for themselves, but they also expect
others to have similarly high standards, thus causing significant disruption to their social
interactions. The rigid and stubborn behaviors are also seen in their financial status, as they are
known to live significantly below their means to prepare financially for a potential catastrophe
. Similarly, they may have difficulty discarding worn-out or worthless items, despite
their lack of sentimental value.
While some argue that OCPD and OCD are one and the same, others believe there is a
distinct difference as the personality disorder lacks definitive obsessions and compulsions (APA,
2013). Although many individuals are diagnosed with both OCD and OCPD, research indicates
that individuals with OCPD are more likely to be diagnosed with major depression, generalized
anxiety disorder, or substance abuse disorder than OCD 
 Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don’t be too particular.

With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The Crossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further on, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t you hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.

Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then must needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.

It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the preacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’

Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”

Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.

It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.

But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost?

Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.

But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be. Christmas dinner table
WHAT HAPPENED TO MOM THAT FAMILY CHRISTMAS
I always love my Family’s Christmas Celebration.  Boozy and filled with laughter, we destroy whatever kitchen we are in with flour from Czech-style homemade potato dumplings as a caraway-covered pork shoulder bubbles in the oven and sauerkraut reduces on the stove. Beer-filled pitchers stand ready to be enjoyed by all, with glasses sized to the ages of the drinkers.  Once we kids all owned homes, Mom, cocktail in hand, pronounced in detail that we would celebrate anywhere but in her kitchen.  She had had enough of scraping potato-glued flour off her counters, floors, and walls.

California snow can be as unpredictable as Family holiday dynamics.  Despite past years of sparse snowfall, that year it had snowed enough to muffle Truckee in a thick skid of white.  As we drove down the long driveway to my Sister’s new house, we watched the cousins gadding about on snowmobiles, my Brother-in-Law in the yard tuning the last few machines so that they were ready for upcoming misadventures. Cocktails in hand, my Parents and Sister greeted us from the front porch as we bounded out of the car and unloaded.

The house was stunning, tall windows and steel overlooking a huge snowy meadow.  Heated concrete floors and a massive fireplace cozied the cavernous living room.   A 25-foot tree sat in the corner, spare and lovely.  My Dad (lover of disaster) shared the story of eight men hauling in, then out of what turned out to be a 35-foot tree; after shortening and replacement the tree tumbled down two hours before my Brother-in-Law’s Company party, shattering most of the glass ornaments.  Miraculously, my Sister added, the ornaments most precious to her remained unbroken.

The kitchen bar and counter easily seated twelve, sitting across from the industrial stove and warming drawers ready for the next day’s destruction.  The counter stepped down at the end, where a mix-your-own cocktail set up was ready.  We toasted tree survival and great snow for play, and our gathered family, missing those away that year.  As the afternoon progressed, I noticed that Mom had availed herself heavily at the bar.  While this behavior from Mom happened, it rarely started during daylight hours and was usually in good cheer.  Whomever was in from snow play was regaled by Mom with stories of woe from their over-55 Villa: friendships gone sour over some HOA offense or party not planned or attended properly.  My Sister and I, long calling the Villa crew High School for grown-ups, rolled our eyes and made a pact to keep an eye on Mom’s sippy cup.

Mom started again the next day as Dad covered the Kids’ hands in flour during dumpling making.  This time it was “advice” to her Grandkids.  Mom was maudlin and a little sloppy.  Oh Mom, I thought, don’t scare the kids.  I had let them forge their own relationships with her, and they all fiercely loved their quirky, creative, book and play loving Grandma despite all experiencing an over-drinking adventure at some point.  Mom was crying quietly by the end, and my Sister and I, concerned, decided that we would talk to her in the New Year.

It wasn’t to be.  Mom died of a massive stroke on the eleventh day of that Christmas.  If it was premonition, medication, or fear that had Mom’s alcohol mood swinging so, I’ll never know.  My siblings and I gathered to celebrate Mom’s life, and together with full sippy cups we determined that there was something she did know.

Family Christmas continues, every year a blessing with Dad, made even more poignant as the Kids and cousins grow, marry, and bring significant others.  Mom would have loved this.  I watch myself now, keeping my sippy cups reasonable.  No promises to stay that way once I become a quirky, creative, book and play loving Grandma.

DIFFERENT NOT DEAD: INTIMACY AFTER 60
It came that month just like it always had for the past 35 years- minus pregnancies. And then it never came again. There had been no signs leading up to this, no peri- only meno.. full on menopause. Which is itself a misnomer because there was no pause – just a dead stop. I was 47 and not happy about this. Am I in the minority to say I loved my period? I loved the days leading up to it, the fullness in my otherwise small breasts, the roundness in my face, the lushness of my hair. And then when it came I felt cleansed, full of youth and renewal. I loved the heightened libido that inevitably followed 14 days later, signaling that I was ovulating and that my husband and I would have to take extra precautions because the best lovemaking of the month was assured for those few days.

I won’t bore you with the hot flashes, as many as 100 per day, every 15 minutes, round the clock. The skin that suddenly went dull and sent me scrambling for anti-aging miracle creams at high-end cosmetics counters. Perhaps the cruelest toll it took on me however, was the complete loss of sexual desire. Me! I’d always been the sexy one, the bawdy one, the one who didn’t hold back on giving and getting. All of a sudden sex hurt.

“It hurts. Penetration hurts.” I hung my head in embarrassment as I tried to explain to my doctor. Her internal examination verified what I already knew.

“You’ve lost all lubrication down there,” she said, and then went on to explain about the thinning of the vaginal walls and the heightened sensitivity-not in a good way- to intercourse. This was almost 20 years ago and there were very few options. Estrogen was just too risky and she wouldn’t prescribe it. She said I could go to a specialist who might but honestly, I was scared of the risks too and just too ashamed. As much as I prided myself on being a feminist and a sexual being, I just could not bring myself to share this most intimate of intimacies. This was not discussed freely among even the closest of friends, there was no Google and so, I pretty much gave up. I didn’t have to learn to please my husband ‘in other ways’ because I always had but he missed the intimacy maybe more than I did. Menopause hurt us both.

There have been no miracles since then. There is no viagra for women but other remedies, while not cures, have been invented. My husband and I have found new ways to make love, to be sexual, in our 60’s. It is not so often and there can be long stretches in between. It is not the house-shakin’ or even bed-shakin’ (better bed maybe?) of our early years but it is still deep and intimate and loving, perhaps more loving than it’s ever been.

We’re that cute couple who come in for dinner early and don’t linger too late because we want to be home in time for Jeopardy. You see us walking side by side at the same time every day each of us with our own ear buds inserted. We’re not in a spat.. or maybe we are. But do not dismiss us as an old married couple who left passion behind. It’s still lurking in surprise places and with a wink and a nod it finds us once again.
I have heard the kids are all going Brazilian. When I first heard that term, I loved the exotic sound of it but was soon left mouth agape upon full disclosure of what it truly meant.  Ok this is it for those BA50s like me who weren’t aware of the full meaning —- no pubic hair – fully stripped, bald, clean as a whistle where every single hair is ripped away from front to back except for a neatly trimmed “landing strip” in the front (or no landing strip at all).

I had gone to hear a reading of the Eve Ensler’s Vagina Monologues in 1998 and I remember Marisa Tomei reading about her boyfriend wanting her to be clean – no hair – and I was aghast – I thought it sounded like her boyfriend must be some kind of pedophile– I read recently in Psychology Today that fully shorn pubic areas have subliminally encouraged men to fantasize about being with young girls …So trust me—a Brazilian was not on my “to do” list.

Well, my girlfriend, just 0ver 50 and recently divorced told me her new boyfriend thought it was sexy to have a Brazilian. OMG I thought,  I have walked the nudist beaches and seen body parts I chose to block out – Suffice it to say I know what’s happening to my upper lids – drooping skin and folds – so don’t tell me you’ve gone and fully exposed your southern hemisphere.  Yes she said with a smirk and frankly it was great for US.  Whoah !

Fast forward to the holidays 2011 when I went for my regular eyebrow waxing. I love this aesthetician – she is Brazilian by the way. She is spunky and fun and always full of great stories. A few times a year I get a bikini wax when I am feeling courageous… the “traditional” follow-the-panty-line version.  During a transitional moment — I had just turned 50 — I ventured from just a “clean up” to a landing strip…(my version) just narrowing the hairline …nothing dramatic.  That was the term I used.  Just thought I should “ramp” it up a bit! It was a tad more painful than the usual but made me feel like I was being a bit edgy.  Surprisingly, I kinda liked it.

Yesterday, I went back for the eye brows and well – my usual aesthetician had some extra time.  So I figured, what the heck, it’s 2012, I’m a proud BA50, , let’s do the landing strip again like we did last year. And so she started —- OMG, sweat from my brow, ripping – OUCH – tearing at me again and again. What was I thinking… this was WAY more painful than I remembered….Why? Oh it’s been so long she told me… you haven’t been here in ages. Ok so it’s my fault. Fine. I made jokes, there is real pain in the world- who cares about my temporary discomfort – I give blood, go to the dentist, experienced childbirth (a long time ok but still….), I can do this. Fifteen minutes later she was done.

I looked down and my jaw dropped. I was BALD , except for a very very VERY thin line of hair and then NADA, Nothing!!! Bald ( I said that already).

“What is this?”  I blurted out – “What is this – is this a Brazilian???”

“Yes of course.” – “But I said a Landing Strip!!”

“Oohh but this is a Brazilian Landing strip!”

And she laughed and I did too –out of nervousness.

I wasn’t mad,  but felt slightly alarmed and ridiculous like a 50-year-old wearing hot pants or going pole dancing.  I had gone to the other side. I felt slightly outrageous and mildy racy. My husband was away on a business trip – I called him and told him that I have a strange new coiff and he should hurry home; He had no idea what I was talking about – I didn’t tell him. For now, I am walking around with my secret and am slightly amused, slightly weirded out and curious about what it will be like with him.

I’ll get back to you on that.  Question is — is this another experiment of what can be

MY ELECTRIC BOYFRIEND
I knew things were about to change when I went shopping for CBD cream and came home with a vibrator. This was before hemp became legal in Massachusetts and you had to buy CBD at questionable places, like the “adult shop” about five miles north of Boston. Since my sex life had been evicerated by my husband’s illness, medication and sheer exhaustion, buying a vibrator suddenly seemed like the easiest way to save the one thing I might be able to control in my life.

I put my CBD cream on the counter and with a surge of bravado, whispered to the cashier who had pins and piercings all over her face, colorful tattoos up and down both arms and a name badge that said My name is Chelsea. How can I help you, “Could you show me where the vibrators are?”

I had no idea why I was whispering as there was no one else in the store but me. Perhaps because nice Jewish girls in their fifties didn’t own vibrators? Or visit porn shops. Or did they? I thought about my divorced friend Lisa and how I was surprised and envious when she said, “I’m taking a break from dating, but thank goodness for my electric boyfriend.” Or Leah, who often referred to using “toys” with or without the men she dated.

So I followed Chelsea to the vibrator aisle, skirting passed graphically packaged items called Booty Call Booty Rocket and Beaded Nipple Clamp Action Clips with my eyes half-closed, worried that I would never be able to unsee them. Hundreds of vibrators were on display in lavender, pink and ivory packaging, reminding me of the feminine products section at CVS. I didn’t know where to begin.

“Um, what’s the difference here?” I asked Chelsea. Unexpectedly, she was quite experienced and after a thorough questioning about how I intended to use the device, she picked out a basic vibrator in a soft pink box, with a USB charging cable for $75. A model that she herself enjoyed. I wasn’t sure how I felt about that, but bought it anyway.

At home, I thought about how to best execute sexual healing using my new electric boyfriend. Would it be alone? Could it be with my husband? Or was this a “WTF was I thinking purchase” ? While I was deciding, I stowed the purple plastic bag containing my vibrator into the dark recesses of my closet so no one would find it. Like bad clockwork, Covid 19 also began its insidious creep into the world and very quickly, the idea of sex became exhausting and overwhelming. Afterall, how does one charge a vibrator, much less use one, when living Pandemic-style with your husband and two adult children? ,

But somehow I feel empowered, just knowing it’s there, sealed in its original packaging in the back of my closet. As my first small act in reclaiming a piece of myself in a 29 year marriage that needs work, my electric boyfriend will always represent bravery that I didn’t know I had. With the words “if not now, when?” echoing in my head I’m looking forward to the dreaded New England winter as a time of new beginnings. And to think that it all started with a vibrator.

DEAR MEN, LET’S TALK ABOUT SEX

This article is for men in “traditional,” heterosexual relationships.

Why, you might ask? Well, in general, (see there – I wrote “in general” – yes, I am generalizing. If the generalization does not apply to you, please don’t be offended. I’m writing this piece based on academic research and client interactions.) In general, people in relationships that we don’t think of as “traditional” have had to find ways to communicate more openly than have others.

With that in mind, here goes…Oh, one more thing, ladies, if your man does not subscribe to Better After 50, feel free to forward this to him. Hopefully it will open the door to increased communication.

Okay, so, guys, let’s talk (pronounced tawk):

Many of your wives/partners are unhappy with the lack of sexual energy between you, in general, and in the bedroom, in particular. They want to discuss this with you but they don’t know how!

The fact of the matter is that when you got together it was likely when you were experiencing a sexual peak. As was dictated by our society, she was focused on having a family. At that time, it was acceptable for you to have “sewn your oats” prior to getting into a long-term relationship. Women, however, have never had that opportunity. We were supposed to be sexy but not sexual and attractive but not to act on attraction.

Things have now changed: We are done raising our families and we have gotten to a point where we would like our lives to be a bit more about us. In some cases, we are discovering parts of ourselves that we didn’t know existed or weren’t allowed (society again) to feel. Another part of the problem is that with life getting in the way for years, we forgot how to connect with you – if we ever really knew how to do so in the first place.

Today we are becoming aware of our own needs and desires – feelings that aren’t based on what is best for the kids, or our parents, or what society expects. In addition, we are beginning to experience our own sexual peak. Based on how our relationships began, we are afraid to talk to you about our needs and desires. In some cases, we fear humiliation or outright rejection. Of course, you don’t plan to ridicule us. But, it is possible that you don’t want the boat rocked or that you would be shocked to learn what is going on in our minds and with our bodies.

And so, we settle for the status quo while talking to our girlfriends about how unhappy we are and fantasize about having hot, sultry affairs. In some cases, we act on those fantasies because we are so desperately lonely in our needs.

You may wonder, why I am telling you all of this. Well, as I said at the beginning, I have based this article on academic readings as well as my experience with many clients. I am hoping to help you and your partner achieve a mutually satisfying love life as well as happiness. Of course,

I realize that you may be afraid to speak to her about all of this. But, if she is giving you this blog post, she clearly wants to have a conversation. In case you’ve found this piece on your own, and are interested in communicating with your partner, here are some possible conversation starters:

“Honey, I just read this great blog post and I’m wondering what you think of it.” Then show her this post.
“Honey, what is something you’ve always wanted to try but feel embarrassed to tell me?” Big caveat here…DO NOT SHAME HER!
“Honey, I would like you to show me what pleases you?” And then pay attention!
“Honey, I’d like us both to discuss our fantasies.” Again, no shaming!Please know that I am not minimizing how difficult it might be to start these conversations. That said, I do think it is a lot easier to have them than to live unfulfilled lives, to experience the pain of infidelity or possibly more painful still, to wind up in divorce court.
My last thought on this topic (for now) … I read recently that most relationship unhappiness is due to unmet expectations. Guys, I can promise you that if your partner brought this blog post to your attention she is really hoping that you will learn to meet her expectations. And, in turn, she wants to meet yours.

WHY I CAN’T HAVE MULTIPLE SEX PARTNERS

That night, I didn’t fully absorb what he was telling me – that he could not be monogamous; that he and I would not be enough.  But as the weeks went on, I began to see that I had fallen in love with someone who was incapable of being content with only one woman. And because I loved him, I couldn’t seriously think of leaving yet.  I imagined Gloria Steinem’s outrage many times.  But then, this wasn’t her experience, it was mine.  So I read everything I could find on the subject – blogs, message boards, essays, psychological journals…..and I learned that polyamorous people are not only able, but compelled, to love multiple people, potentially, at one time.  Limiting this kind of person’s capacity for love to only one partner feels restrictive, repressive, even unnatural to them somehow.  Yet it can be difficult to live openly as a polyamorous person.  In fact, as I found out later, Daniel had begun dating me in the hopes of being monogamous.  But eventually those old desires began to build and bubble up again, creating something like a maddening itch that first whispers but eventually screams to be scratched.

If this was Daniel’s true nature, how could I ask him to constrain it?  Yet how could I go so decidedly against my own?  But then the question arose:  did I truly know my own nature?  I had never really explored anything other than monogamy…..

            So eventually, I decided to try it.  

What followed was an intricate negotiation of how our relationship would work. We lovingly and carefully laid out the boundaries.  And at first, this seemed to be working. Yet on some level I knew I was functioning in deep denial….because my world intentionally never collided with the other women.  We agreed not speak of the others, so it was almost as if they didn’t exist.  At the most unexpected moments, though, they would invade my thoughts.  In my mind, these women were always thinner, younger, and more sexually provocative than me.  The more these thoughts plagued my mind, the deeper into anxiety and depression I sank.   

After several months vacillating between leaving and staying, I decided that one final test would either fortify my ability to share him or finally end it.  I asked him to break our silence agreement and tell me about the last woman he was with. 

She was Asian. Petite (Oh God). Fun. Flirty. Sexy. Her name was Amy.  I was steady enough as he spoke, maintaining my neutral intake of the facts.  But then, he mentioned offhandedly that she loved to bake cookies.  Cookies?  I could have handled dildos, costumes, sex games, even strange fetishes.  But I could not handle such a delicate, intimate fact about her.  I could almost physically feel the denial being shattered, like a tiny crack in a fragile piece of glass. And that small fact was what did it in the end. I knew in that moment that I could not share his affection.  I could view the other, whoever she was in the moment, as a sexual being, but seeing her as a fully realized person, with feelings, with passions, maybe even with a loving heart, was just too much. I ended the relationship the following week.

And when I think back on that experience, I wonder….was I too insecure to handle an open relationship?  Or was ending it the healthy exercise of an appropriate, loving boundary for myself?  I’m not sure. I’m not sorry for having experienced what I did with Daniel. It allowed me to push and explore my own ideas about sex, love, and commitment in ways I never would have considered before.  It also taught me that it’s possible to truly love someone who does not completely share your values.  The way that Daniel needs to love many is something I can’t understand.  It breaks my heart to think that he may never fully experience the powerful intimacy and simplicity of just two people.  But I can’t judge him, either.  His heart’s desires are honest and sincere.  And though Daniel may forever remain an elusive, powerful force, ever-moving from one heart to another, I hope that he finds love, joy, and contentment on his path.  I simply cannot walk it with him

ARE WE STILL ALLOWED TO FEEL SEXUAL AFTER 50?

I hear it over and over again: Many 40+ year-old women, who are in otherwise happy relationships, are desperately unhappy with their sex lives. Sometimes the couple started out this way and these women thought things would get better. Other times they conformed to the societal message that women’s sexual pleasure and satisfaction were irrelevant and so they settled. More often, however, the couple started out hot and heavy and life got in the way.

Yes, it is true that women generally reach their sexual peak after approximately 40 years of age while men reach theirs in their late teens or early twenties. It is often not until women are done caring for their kids, spouses, parents, etc., etc., that women may even begin to recognize that they have a desire for, and a right to, a good and satisfying sex life. By this point, though, many women don’t know how to ask for what they want or are afraid to do so.

Some women in my practice have gone months, if not years, in sexless relationships. Oftentimes they feel their partner is no longer attracted to them or they feel shame around asking for what they want. If this piece resonates with you, please know that you are not alone. I am also hoping to empower you by letting you know a bit about how we, as a society, got to this point and about the many benefits associated with a satisfying sex life.

Most of us know that engaging in consensual sex is great for reducing stress. Some of us even know that the hormones secreted during sex are attachment hormones and, therefore, can leave us feeling better connected with our partners. But, what many of us don’t know is that there are a lot of other benefits to sex like a decrease in eating disorders, less vaginal atrophy, diminished anxiety, and lower rates of depression.

So, why the taboo around female sexuality? There are so many reasons. In fact, during my funny and informative workshop called, “The Ridiculous History of Female Sexuality: Why it Matters,” I discuss the history of female sexuality and how it has brought us to this point. Can you believe that people once thought that a woman’s ailments were due to her uterus wandering about her body and wreaking havoc wherever it went? How about the fact that when it was discovered that the female orgasm was not necessary for procreation[i], women’s sexual pleasure became unimportant? In addition, it was as recent as 2004 that there was a law in Texas making it a crime for a woman to own more than six vibrators[ii].

Women have been socialized to accept shame regarding their bodies, their sexuality, and their sexual desire[iii]. Shame has been passed on between generations[iv] in the form of silence and the utilization of terms intended to diminish and even vilify a woman’s sexuality[v]. This is evidenced by the fact that medical drawings and medical literature from only a few years ago do not include a complete depiction or understanding of female genitalia[vi]. In addition, it was very recently that the medication Addy[vii] became available to treat female hypoactive sexual desire disorder. This was despite the fact that a medication made up of components known to increase blood flow to the female genitalia (the same mechanism of action as for the medications that treat male erectile dysfunction) had been available for quite some time[viii]. In sharp contrast, Viagra was fast-tracked to become available for men[ix].

A healthy relationship to one’s sexuality is an important aspect of wellbeing and happiness. Via workshops and in my private practice, I am passionate (pun absolutely intended) about helping women to achieve this relationship. I am certain that this will not only lead to stronger, more fulfilling relationships but this can also lead to better emotional and physical health, overall.
1] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:
[2] Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.
[3] Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.
[4] John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
[5] And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
[6] And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
[7] Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.
[8] I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
[9] I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
[10] I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,
[11] Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
[12] And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
[13] And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.
[14] His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;
[15] And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.
[16] And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.
[17] And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:
[18] I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.
[19] Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;
[20] The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.
.2
[1] Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;
[2] I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:
[3] And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.
[4] Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.
[5] Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.
[6] But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
[7] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
[8] And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;
[9] I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
[10] Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
[11] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.
[12] And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;
[13] I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.
[14] But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.
[15] So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.
[16] Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
[17] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.
[18] And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;
[19] I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.
[20] Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.
[21] And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.
[22] Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.
[23] And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.
[24] But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.
[25] But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.
[26] And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:
[27] And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.
[28] And I will give him the morning star.
[29] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
.3
[1] And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.
[2] Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.
[3] Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.
[4] Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.
[5] He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
[6] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
[7] And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;
[8] I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
[9] Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
[10] Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.
[11] Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.
[12] Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.
[13] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
[14] And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;
[15] I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
[16] So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.
[17] Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:
[18] I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.
[19] As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.
[20] Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
[21] To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.
[22] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

[1] After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.
[2] And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.
[3] And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.
[4] And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.
[5] And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
[6] And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.
[7] And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.
[8] And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.
[9] And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,
[10] The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
[11] Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
.5
[1] And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.
[2] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
[3] And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.
[4] And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.
[5] And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.
[6] And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
[7] And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
[8] And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.
[9] And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
[10] And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.
[11] And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
[12] Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.
[13] And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
[14] And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.
1] And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:
[2] With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
[3] So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
[4] And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:
[5] And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
[6] And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.
[7] And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.
[8] The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
[9] And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.
[10] And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.
[11] And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.
[12] And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.
[13] These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.
[14] These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.
[15] And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
[16] And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.
[17] For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
[18] And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.

I TOOK THE SEX CHALLENGE AND…

During a recent dinner with my girlfriends from Orangetheory Fitness, I brought up the challenge that my husband and I did last winter. We were having a good time with lots of girl talk, eating guacamole and chips with our tequila, and the memory just popped up and then, in my typically unfiltered fashion, out of my mouth.

“A sex challenge?” Lisa asked. I nodded, explaining that the test involved both partners committing to seven continuous nights under the sheets.

“What??” They cried. One woman complained that her husband traveled, another girlfriend said that her bed was so squeaky she feared her kids could hear. One friend gave a flat “no way” because she still had little ones up at all hours of the night. I concurred that they each had valid excuses. I am an empty nester so the roadblocks to spending quality time together are far less for my guy and me. However, we have been married for almost three decades and there are times when, although we may not have kids at home, work and stress (him), hormonal changes (me) and the comfort of being in a long-term relationship (us) seem to get in the way of intimacy. Truthfully, I take our coupling for granted more than I should. Knowing that he loves me and is a constant in my life is just such an easy way out of all the other stuff. However, as we discovered, getting busy in bed can be marriage’s superglue.

After my girls’ night, I became curious about where this whole sex challenge idea originated. It couldn’t have been my middle-aged friend’s light bulb idea. Most of my peers feel that a good book and a salty snack are equivalent to having Jon Hamm in bed these 50 year-old years. Time to Google my writer self exclaimed. I was amazed at how many relevant topics appeared. There is a book titled 7 Days of Sex Challenge, a Lifetime reality show of the same name and articles from church pastors about doing the deed for 30 straight nights to make a marriage stronger. Cosmopolitan magazine posted a piece suggesting 77 positions in 77 days. I think I will leave that one to the under 30 crowd; I can’t see any of my body parts attempting the circus acts beyond position 9. The Dating Divas blog not only describes the rules of the challenge but also offers products as incentives, and this instructional video:



Since we did it for a week, I read the forward of the 7-day book by Tony and Alisa DiLorenzo (110 pages would have to wait.)  Their first challenge stemmed from 11 years of marriage and consisted of having sex 60 times in 60 days. They ONLY made it 40 of those 60 days. Woah, I thought, doing math on my fingers. That’s like five days a week for two months straight. I think my husband would never go to work if I suggested we try this one.

When I first suggested we do this crazy challenge, it was at a time when I was feeling disconnected from everything. My girls had been away at school for two years, enough time for it to really sink in that they wouldn’t be walking in the door every night. I had just completed two years of time-consuming volunteer work and was trying to finish my first book. I wanted to feel that our bond was strong and that I still had it, whatever ‘it’ is. This whole idea stemmed from my selfish desires, but in the end it was something we both needed. I didn’t realize how lonely he was; working ten-hour days and eating dinner by the television light long after I was in bed. It’s silly to look at our love as something that needs an instruction booklet, but this exercise helped reignite something we had misplaced. I don’t think the challenge solves all the problems that couples have, but can be an important reminder that marriage is a marathon and not just a sprint mired in the daily grind.

Years ago, I had the honor of introducing famous sexpert Dr. Ruth Westheimer at a charity event for 500 women. When she stepped onto the podium, she asked if my husband was in the room. In the back, I told her, standing by the door (ready to flee.) She posed this question to him in front of the audience; did he know what the key was to a long-term marriage? My husband shook his head and probably had his hand on the exit door

“Change positions!” Dr Ruth belted across the giant abyss of women, which got quite the group guffaw. But she was right. By changing things up and challenging each other, we became more connected and happier to be in each other’s company. There is always time for a bowl of pretzels and a good read…after.

LOW SEXUAL DESIRE DOES NOT MEAN YOU’RE BROKEN
Walker ThorntonWALKER THORNTONDECEMBER 8, 2016998 VIEWS

midlife sexLately my email box has been full of articles on the topic of libido/desire.  Most of them are poorly disguised marketing ploys, scare tactics designed to make women feel inadequate.

Sexual desire isn’t something you can fix by eating more blueberries or indulging in oysters. It’s not as simple as popping a pill. We can’t force it–in fact I can think of nothing worse than feeling obligated to fake desire in order to please a partner. Especially if the subliminal message is that a woman’s job is to satisfy her man sexually and therefore she must do whatever is necessary. (I do believe there are times when we can approach the possibility of having sex without desire, and allow ourselves to be open to what shows up. Or doesn’t. And I talk about that in my book, Inviting Desire.)

In my own past experience and in what I hear from women, the struggle around sexual desire is a real one for some of us. And there are many businesses out there trying to capitalize on the popular notion that women with low sexual desire are broken and therefore need medicine or expensive toys/vibrators to stimulate their brains or bodies into feeling desire.

But here’s the thing: We Are Not Broken.

When sexual desire is absent, or not showing up the way we are told it should, the default is to label women as faulty. Broken.

So let me repeat this. Low sexual desire does not mean you are broken.

Women face such conflicting messages about their sexuality. We are raised to be “good girls” and then exposed to thousands of images of women as sex objects–while being told to remain chaste, pure, virginal. Then as we reach the menopausal years we are told that sex will become horribly painful. But we don’t really need sex anymore because older people don’t enjoy sex.  The men around us are using Viagra and other ED drugs and have a perpetual hard-on that we are expected to enjoy and be willing vehicles for–regardless of how we might feel about our own body or the relationship.

And then we struggle with our own sexual desire? Of course we do.

I believe that we/women have to educate ourselves about our bodies, our senses, our personal rhythms, and our wants and needs. We also have to understand that we are not broken. Our sexuality is normal, because there is no ONE way to experience sexual desire.

How do we do this? Maybe that process is one of reeducating ourselves in how to love and live in our own bodies. Some women may need to be taught how to pleasure their bodies—with specifics. Some women may feel the need for permission to own their sexuality. (You may want or need something completely different.) That isn’t something we were taught. Or encouraged to do. We talk about the mechanics of sex but fail to talk about the incredibly simple yet amazingly complex idea of pleasure—ours, his (because most of us are raised in a heterocentric culture) and the pleasure to be had with a partner.

There are women in their 50’s who have never had an orgasm. Who can’t locate their clitoris. Who have never looked at their vulvas. They are in some sense disconnected from their bodies–because it’s the way we were raised as women in this culture. Sadly too many women feel shame about their bodies and their sexuality.

My frustration with the way we approach sexuality and the experience of women who share their stories with me was the impetus for writing Inviting Desire.

The first step to inviting desire into our lives is to embrace our bodies—just as they are.  In the book I help women to think about what their bodies need.  Starting with the basics–how do I respond to tastes, sights, smells, touch. What feels good, what turns me on?  I encourage women to touch themselves, to feel their bodies in the most basic tactile way. Then to go deeper, to explore sexually–not just to learn to have bigger better orgasms.

The book is written as a series of daily readings to help women learn how their bodies respond to pleasure and what they want. There is a day, with exercises, on how to ask for what you want and how to cope when it’s not working in a relationship. There’s a day for those women who are not in relationships–because they’re still sexual beings. We talk about a ‘sexy toolkit’ of items and skills to help women understand their desire.

My goal for the book, and my work, is to help women embrace their sexuality and their bodies. The basic premise is not that we are broken as women, to the contrary we have these lovely bodies and wants and desires just wanting for us to give ourselves permission.  Inviting Desire does that through a series of articles, with simple exercises designed to get you thinking and exploring ways to expand your desire. It’s not an overly explicit book; it’s not a book about how to please a man or be a better lover.  It is a book about how you bring desire into your life–what you do from there is up to you.

he most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human race form transient incidents. They have hinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism. But it is not from them that there came the single glimpse of forbidden eons which chills me when I think of it and maddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse, like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed out from an accidental piecing together of separated things—in this case an old newspaper item and the notes of a dead professor. I hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out; certainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply a link in so hideous a chain. I think that the professor, too intended to keep silent regarding the part he knew, and that he would have destroyed his notes had not sudden death seized him.

My knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926-27 with the death of my great-uncle, George Gammell , Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Professor  was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions, and had frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums; so that his passing at the age of ninety-two may be recalled by many. Locally, interest was intensified by the obscurity of the cause of death. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from the Newport boat; falling suddenly; as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a nautical-looking negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the deceased's home in Williams Street. Physicians were unable to find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible for the end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, but latterly I am inclined to wonder—and more than wonder.

As my great-uncle's heir and executor, for he died a childless widower, I was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for that purpose moved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in Boston. Much of the material which I correlated will be later published by the American Archaeological Society, but there was one box which I found exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much averse from showing to other eyes. It had been locked and I did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal ring which the professor carried in his pocket. Then, indeed, I succeeded in opening it, but when I did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more closely locked barrier. For what could be the meaning of the queer clay bas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings which I found? Had my uncle, in his latter years become credulous of the most superficial impostures? I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent disturbance of an old man's peace of mind.

The bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by six inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs, however, were far from modern in atmosphere and suggestion; for, although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild, they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing. And writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly to be; though my memory, despite much the papers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify this particular species, or even hint at its remotest affiliations.

Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evident pictorial intent, though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature. It seemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could conceive. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful. Behind the figure was a vague suggestions of a Cyclopean architectural background.

The writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of press cuttings, in Professor 's most recent hand; and made no pretense to literary style. What seemed to be the main document was headed "CTHULHU CULT" in characters painstakingly printed to avoid the erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of. This manuscript was divided into two sections, the first of which was headed "1925—Dream and Dream Work of H.A. Wilcox, 7 Thomas St., Providence, R. I.", and the second, "Narrative of Inspector John R. Legrasse, 121 Bienville St., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg.—Notes on Same, & Prof. Webb's Acct." The other manuscript papers were brief notes, some of them accounts of the queer dreams of different persons, some of them citations from theosophical books and magazines (notably W. Scott-Elliot's Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria), and the rest comments on long-surviving secret societies and hidden cults, with references to passages in such mythological and anthropological source-books as Frazer's Golden Bough and Miss Murray's Witch-Cult in Western Europe. The cuttings largely alluded to outré mental illness and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925.

The first half of the principal manuscript told a very particular tale. It appears that on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon Professor  bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and fresh. His card bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle had recognized him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at the Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building near that institution. Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity, and had from childhood excited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating. He called himself "psychically hypersensitive", but the staid folk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely "queer." Never mingling much with his kind, he had dropped gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a small group of esthetes from other towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its conservatism, had found him quite hopeless.

On the occasion of the visit, ran the professor's manuscript, the sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host's archeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics of the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy; and my uncle showed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but archeology. Young Wilcox's rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which I have since found highly characteristic of him. He said, "It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon."

It was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been a slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in New England for some years; and Wilcox's imagination had been keenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean cities of Titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters: "Cthulhu fhtagn."

This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed Professor . He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness; and studied with frantic intensity the bas-relief on which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad only in his night clothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him. My uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterwards said, for his slowness in recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial design. Many of his questions seemed highly out of place to his visitor, especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor  became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man, during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two sounds frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters "Cthulhu" and "R'lyeh."

On March 23, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and inquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in Waterman Street. He had cried out in the night, arousing several other artists in the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium. My uncle at once telephoned the family, and from that time forward kept close watch of the case; calling often at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to be in charge. The youth's febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things; and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them. They included not only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing "miles high" which walked or lumbered about.

He at no time fully described this object but occasional frantic words, as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the professor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this object, the doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man's subsidence into lethargy. His temperature, oddly enough, was not greatly above normal; but the whole condition was otherwise such as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder.

On April 2 at about 3 P.M. every trace of Wilcox's malady suddenly ceased. He sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the night of March 22. Pronounced well by his physician, he returned to his quarters in three days; but to Professor  he was of no further assistance. All traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of his night-thoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions.

Here the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain of the scattered notes gave me much material for thought—so much, in fact, that only the ingrained skepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my continued distrust of the artist. The notes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which young Wilcox had had his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a prodigiously far-flung body of inquires amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time past. The reception of his request seems to have varied; but he must, at the very least, have received more responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary. This original correspondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest. Average people in society and business—New England's traditional "salt of the earth" —gave an almost completely negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions appear here and there, always between March 23 and April 2—the period of young Wilcox's delirium. Scientific men were little more affected, though four cases of vague description suggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something abnormal.

It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I know that panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes. As it was, lacking their original letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see. That is why I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow cognizant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from esthetes told disturbing tale. From February 28 to April 2 a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor's delirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported scenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with emphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on the date of young Wilcox's seizure, and expired several months later after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have often wondered if all the objects of the professor's questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever reach them.

The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and eccentricity during the given period. Professor  must have employed a cutting bureau, for the number of extracts was tremendous, and the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here was a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry. Here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic deduces a dire future from visions he has seen. A dispatch from California describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some "glorious fulfillment" which never arrives, whilst items from India speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March 22-23.

The west of Ireland, too, is full of wild rumor and legendry, and a fantastic painter named Ardois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous Dream Landscape in the Paris spring salon of 1926. And so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane asylums that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions. A weird bunch of cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with which I set them aside. But I was then convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor.

PART II. — THE TALE OF INSPECTOR LEGRASSE
THE older matters which had made the sculptor's dream and bas-relief so significant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript. Once before, it appears, Professor  had seen the hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics, and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as "Cthulhu"; and all this in so stirring and horrible a connection that it is small wonder he pursued young Wilcox with queries and demands for data.

This earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before, when the American Archaeological Society held its annual meeting in St. Louis. Professor , as befitted one of his authority and attainments, had had a prominent part in all the deliberations; and was one of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct answering and problems for expert solution.

The chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had traveled all the way from New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source. His name was John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an Inspector of Police. With him he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss to determine. It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the least interest in archaeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was prompted by purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish, or whatever it was, had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of New Orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with it, that the police could not but realize that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them, and infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of its origin, apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain-head.

Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering created. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a state of tense excitement, and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas. No recognized school of sculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stone.

The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship. It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of the wings touched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the center, whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way clown toward the bottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the croucher's elevated knees. The aspect of the whole was abnormally life-like, and the more subtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and incalculable age was unmistakable; yet not one link did it show with any known type of art belonging to civilization's youth—or indeed to any other time. Totally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the soapy, greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy. The characters along the base were equally baffling; and no member present, despite a representation of half the world's expert learning in this field, could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic kinship. They, like the subject and material, belonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it, something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our world and our conceptions have no part.

And yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the Inspector's problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew. This person was the late William Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropology in Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note. Professor Webb had been engaged, forty-eight years before, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions which he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Esquimaux whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which other Esquimaux knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made. Besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from an aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew how. But just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs. It was, the professor stated, a very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing. And so far as he could tell, it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting.

This data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members, proved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at once to ply his informant with questions. Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swamp cult-worshipers his men had arrested, he besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst the diabolist Esquimaux. There then followed an exhaustive comparison of details, and a moment of really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart. What, in substance, both the Esquimaux wizards and the Louisiana swamp-priests had chanted to their kindred idols was something very like this: the word-divisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in the phrase as chanted aloud:

"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn."

Legrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among his mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the words meant. This text, as given, ran something like this:

"In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming."

And now, in response to a general and urgent demand, Inspector Legrasse related as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshipers; telling a story to which I could see my uncle attached profound significance. It savored of the wildest dreams of myth-maker and theosophist, and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such half-castes and pariahs as might be least expected to possess it.

On November 1st, 1907, there had come to the New Orleans police a frantic summons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters there, mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of Lafitte's men, were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night. It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever known; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the malevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling chants and dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger added, the people could stand it no more.

So a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide. At the end of the passable road they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day never came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create. At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in sight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms was now faintly audible far, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through pale undergrowth beyond the endless avenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the cowed squatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before.

The region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute, substantially unknown and untraversed by white men. There were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge, formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes; and squatters whispered that bat-winged devils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship it at midnight. They said it had been there before d'Iberville, before La Salle, before the Indians, and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself, and to see it was to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to keep away. The present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds and incidents.

Only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasse's men as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and muffled tom-toms. There are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is terrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other. Animal fury and orgiastic license here whipped themselves to daemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstasies that tore and reverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell. Now and then the less organized ululation would cease, and from what seemed a well-drilled chorus of hoarse voices would rise in sing-song chant that hideous phrase or ritual:

"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn."

Then the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came suddenly in sight of the spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one fainted, and two were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the face of the fainting man, and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotized with horror.

In a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre's extent, clear of trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a Sime or an Angarola could paint. Void of clothing, this hybrid spawn were braying, bellowing, and writhing about a monstrous ring-shaped bonfire; in the center of which, revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame, stood a great granite monolith some eight feet in height; on top of which, incongruous in its diminutiveness, rested the noxious carven statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular intervals with the flame-girt monolith as a center hung, head downward, the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who had disappeared. It was inside this circle that the ring of worshipers jumped and roared, the general direction of the mass motion being from left to right in endless Bacchanal between the ring of bodies and the ring of fire.

It may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which induced one of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror. This man, Joseph D. Galvez, I later met and questioned; and he proved distractingly imaginative. He indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest trees but I suppose he had been hearing too much native superstition.

Actually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration. Duty came first; and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the throng, the police relied on their firearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout. For five minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description. Wild blows were struck, shots were fired, and escapes were made; but in the end Legrasse was able to count some forty-seven sullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows of policemen. Five of the worshipers lay dead, and two severely wounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their fellow-prisoners. The image on the monolith, of course, was carefully removed and carried back by Legrasse.

Examined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness, the prisoners all proved to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and mentally aberrant type. Most were seamen, and a sprinkling of Negroes and mulattoes, largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape Verde Islands, gave a colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult. But before many questions were asked, it became manifest that something far deeper and older than Negro fetishism was involved. Degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures held with surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith.

They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died. This was that cult, and the prisoners said it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of R'lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cult would always be waiting to liberate him.

Meanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret which even torture could not extract. Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth, for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful few. But these were not the Great Old Ones. No man had ever seen the Old Ones. The carven idol was great Cthulhu, but none might say whether or not the others were precisely like him. No one could read the old writing now, but things were told by word of mouth. The chanted ritual was not the secret—that was never spoken aloud, only whispered. The chant meant only this: "In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming."

Only two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged, and the rest were committed to various institutions. All denied a part in the ritual murders, and averred that the killing had been done by Black Winged Ones which had come to them from their immemorial meeting-place in the haunted wood. But of those mysterious allies no coherent account could ever be gained. What the police did extract, came mainly from the immensely aged mestizo named Castro, who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the cult in the mountains of China.

Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed. There had been aeons when other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had great cities. Remains of Them, he said the deathless Chinamen had told him, were still be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in the Pacific. They all died vast epochs of time before men came, but there were arts which could revive Them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of eternity. They had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought Their images with Them.

These Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether of flesh and blood. They had shape—for did not this star-fashioned image prove it?—but that shape was not made of matter. When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They no longer lived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious surrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside must serve to liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved them intact likewise prevented Them from making an initial move, and They could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions of years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe, for Their mode of speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs. When, after infinities of chaos, the first men came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding their dreams; for only thus could Their language reach the fleshly minds of mammals.

Then, whispered Castro, those first men formed the cult around tall idols which the Great Ones showed them; idols brought in dim eras from dark stars. That cult would never die till the stars came right again, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would be easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and levelling in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their return.

In the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in dreams, but then something happened. The great stone city R'lyeh, with its monoliths and sepulchers, had sunk beneath the waves; and the deep waters, full of the one primal mystery through which not even thought can pass, had cut off the spectral intercourse. But memory never died, and the high-priests said that the city would rise again when the stars were right. Then came out of the earth the black spirits of earth, mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumors picked up in caverns beneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not speak much. He cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction. The size of the Old Ones, too, he curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he said that he thought the center lay amid the pathless desert of Arabia, where Irem, the City of Pillars, dreams hidden and untouched. It was not allied to the European witch-cult, and was virtually unknown beyond its members. No book had ever really hinted of it, though the deathless Chinamen said that there were double meanings in the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated might read as they chose, especially the much-discussed couplet:

That is not dead which can eternal lie,
And with strange aeons even death may die.

Legrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired in vain concerning the historic affiliations of the cult. Castro, apparently, had told the truth when he said that it was wholly secret. The authorities at Tulane University could shed no light upon either cult or image, and now the detective had come to the highest authorities in the country and met with no more than the Greenland tale of Professor Webb.

The feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasse's tale, corroborated as it was by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who attended; although scant mention occurs in the formal publications of the society. Caution is the first care of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture. Legrasse for some time lent the image to Professor Webb, but at the latter's death it was returned to him and remains in his possession, where I viewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably akin to the dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.

That my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder, for what thoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge of what Legrasse had learned of the cult, of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the swamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come in his dreams upon at least three of the precise words of the formula uttered alike by Esquimaux diabolists and mongrel Louisianans?. Professor 's instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminently natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having heard of the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle's expense. The dream-narratives and cuttings collected by the professor were, of course, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions. So, after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man.

Wilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas Street, a hideous Victorian imitation of seventeenth century Breton Architecture which flaunts its stuccoed front amidst the lovely colonial houses on the ancient hill, and under the very shadow of the finest Georgian steeple in America, I found him at work in his rooms, and at once conceded from the specimens scattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic. He will, I believe, some time be heard from as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallized in clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and fantasies which Arthur Machen evokes in prose, and  makes visible in verse and in painting.

Dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock and asked me my business without rising. Then I told him who I was, he displayed some interest; for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strange dreams, yet had never explained the reason for the study. I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought with some subtlety to draw him out. In a short time I became convinced of his absolute sincerity, for he spoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake. They and their subconscious residuum had influenced his art profoundly, and he showed me a morbid statue whose contours almost made me shake with the potency of its black suggestion. He could not recall having seen the original of this thing except in his own dream bas-relief, but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his hands. It was, no doubt, the giant shape he had raved of in delirium. That he really knew nothing of the hidden cult, save from what my uncle's relentless catechism had let fall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in which he could possibly have received the weird impressions.

He talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me see with terrible vividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone—whose geometry, he oddly said, was all wrong—and hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless, half-mental calling from underground: "Cthulhu fhtagn", "Cthulhu fhtagn."

These words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead Cthulhu's dream-vigil in his stone vault at R'lyeh, and I felt deeply moved despite my rational beliefs. Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of the cult in some casual way, and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading and imagining. Later, by virtue of its sheer impressiveness, it had found subconscious expression in dreams, in the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I now beheld; so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one. The youth was of a type, at once slightly affected and slightly ill-mannered, which I could never like, but I was willing enough now to admit both his genius and his honesty. I took leave of him amicably, and wish him all the success his talent promises.

The matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times I had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and connections. I visited New Orleans, talked with Legrasse and others of that old-time raiding-party, saw the frightful image, and even questioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived. Old Castro, unfortunately, had been dead for some years. What I now heard so graphically at first-hand, though it was really no more than a detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written, excited me afresh; for I felt sure that I was on the track of a very real, very secret, and very ancient religion whose discovery would make me an anthropologist of note. My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, as I wish it still were, and I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by Professor .

One thing I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know, is that my uncle's death was far from natural. He fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an ancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels, after a careless push from a Negro sailor. I did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cult-members in Louisiana, and would not be surprised to learn of secret methods and rites and beliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone; but in Norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the deeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptor's data have come to sinister ears?. I think Professor  died because he knew too much, or because he was likely to learn too much. Whether I shall go as he did remains to be seen, for I have learned much now.

PART III. — THE MADNESS FROM THE SEA
IF heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelf-paper. It was nothing on which I would naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round, for it was an old number of an Australian journal, the Sydney Bulletin for April 18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle's research.

I had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor  called the "Cthulhu Cult", and was visiting a learned friend in Paterson, New Jersey; the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend had wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had found in the swamp.

Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in detail; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length. What it suggested, however, was of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate action. It read as follows:

MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA

Vigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow. One Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of Desperate Battle and Deaths at Sea. Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars of Strange Experience. Odd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry to Follow.

The Morrison Co.'s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this morning at its wharf in Darling Harbor, having in tow the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam yacht Alert of Dunedin, N.Z., which was sighted April 12th in S. Latitude 34°21', W. Longitude 152°17', with one living and one dead man aboard.

The Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April  was driven considerably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster waves. On April 12th the derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a half-delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week. The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin, about foot in height, regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and the Museum in College Street all profess complete bafflement, and which the survivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of common pattern.

This man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story of piracy and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been second mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February 20th with a complement of eleven men. The Emma, he says, was delayed and thrown widely south of her course by the great storm of March 1st, and on March 2, in S. Latitude 49°51' W. Longitude 128°34', encountered the Alert, manned by a queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas and half-castes. Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused; whereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the schooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yacht's equipment. The Emma's men showed fight, says the survivor, and though the schooner began to sink from shots beneath the water-line they managed to heave alongside their enemy and board her, grappling with the savage crew on the yacht's deck, and being forced to kill them all, the number being slightly superior, because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though rather clumsy mode of fighting.

Three of the Emma's men, including Capt. Collins and First Mate Green, were killed; and the remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen proceeded to navigate the captured yacht, going ahead in their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering back had existed. The next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island, although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm. Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage her, but were beaten about by the storm of April , From that time till his rescue on the 12th the man remembers little, and he does not even recall when William Briden, his companion, died. Briden's death reveals no apparent cause, and was probably due to excitement or exposure. Cable advices from Dunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an island trader, and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront, It was owned by a curious group of half-castes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little curiosity; and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors of March 1st. Our Auckland correspondent gives the Emma and her crew an excellent reputation, and Johansen is described as a sober and worthy man. The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginning tomorrow, at which every effort will be made to induce Johansen to speak more freely than he has done hitherto.

This was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what a train of ideas it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries of data on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land. What motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back the Emma as they sailed about with their hideous idol? What was the unknown island on which six of the Emma's crew had died, and about which the mate Johansen was so secretive? What had the vice-admiralty's investigation brought out, and what was known of the noxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvelous of all, what deep and more than natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable significance to the various turns of events so carefully noted by my uncle?

March 1st—or February 28th according to the International Date Line—the earthquake and storm had come. From Dunedin the Alert and her noisome crew had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned, and on the other side of the earth poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange, dank Cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had moulded in his sleep the form of the dreaded Cthulhu. March 23rd the crew of the Emma landed on an unknown island and left six men dead; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster's malign pursuit, whilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium! And what of this storm of April —the date on which all dreams of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged unharmed from the bondage of strange fever? What of all this—and of those hints of old Castro about the sunken, star-born Old Ones and their coming reign; their faithful cult and their mastery of dreams? Was I tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man's power to bear? If so, they must be horrors of the mind alone, for in some way the second of April had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of mankind's soul.

That evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my host adieu and took a train for San Francisco. In less than a month I was in Dunedin; where, however, I found that little was known of the strange cult-members who had lingered in the old sea-taverns. Waterfront scum was far too common for special mention; though there was vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had made, during which faint drumming and red flame were noted on the distant hills. In Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned with yellow hair turned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at Sydney, and had thereafter sold his cottage in West Street and sailed with his wife to his old home in Oslo. Of his stirring experience he would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty officials, and all they could do was to give me his Oslo address.

After that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members of the vice-admiralty court. I saw the Alert, now sold and in commercial use, at Circular Quay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing from its non-committal bulk. The crouching image with its cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal, was preserved in the Museum at Hyde Park; and I studied it long and well, finding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship, and with the same utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness of material which I had noted in Legrasse's smaller specimen. Geologists, the curator told me, had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed that the world held no rock like it. Then I thought with a shudder of what Old Castro had told Legrasse about the Old Ones; "They had come from the stars, and had brought Their images with Them."

Shaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I now resolved to visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I re-embarked at once for the Norwegian capital; and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in the shadow of the Egeberg. Johansen's address, I discovered, lay in the Old Town of King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive the name of Oslo during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as "Christiana." I made the brief trip by taxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and ancient building with plastered front. A sad-faced woman in black answered my summons, and I was stung th disappointment when she told me in halting English that Gustaf Johansen was no more.

He had not long survived his return, said his wife, for the doings sea in 1925 had broken him. He had told her no more than he told the public, but had left a long manuscript—of "technical matters" as he said— written in English, evidently in order to guard her from the peril of casual perusal. During a walk rough a narrow lane near the Gothenburg dock, a bundle of papers falling from an attic window had knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors at once helped him to his feet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead. Physicians found no adequate cause the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened constitution. I now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me till I, too, am at rest; "accidentally" or otherwise. Persuading the widow that my connection with her husband's "technical matters" was sufficient to entitle me to his manuscript, I bore the document away and began to read it on the London boat.

It was a simple, rambling thing—a naive sailor's effort at a post-facto diary—and strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage. I cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundancy, but I will tell its gist enough to show why the sound the water against the vessel's sides became so unendurable to me that I stopped my ears with cotton.

Johansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the city and the Thing, but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space, and of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath the sea, known and favored by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them upon the world whenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the sun and air.

Johansen's voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty. The Emma, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full force of that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that filled men's dreams. Once more under control, the ship was making good progress when held up by the Alert on March 2, and I could feel the mate's regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends on the Alert he speaks with significant horror. There was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction seem almost a duty, and Johansen shows ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under Johansen's command, the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47°9', W. Longitude l23°43', come upon a coastline of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth's supreme terror—the nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh, that was built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration. All this Johansen did not suspect, but God knows he soon saw enough!

I suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned citadel whereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the waters. When I think of the extent of all that may be brooding down there I almost wish to kill myself forthwith. Johansen and his men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of elder daemons, and must have guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet. Awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith, and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the queer image found in the shrine on the Alert, is poignantly visible in every line of the mates frightened description.

Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing any definite structure or building, he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces—surfaces too great to belong to anything right or proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs. I mention his talk about angles because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his awful dreams. He said that the geometry of the dream-place he saw was abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours. Now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality.

Johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous Acropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase. The very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarizing miasma welling out from this sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second glance showed concavity after the first showed convexity.

Something very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything more definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each would have fled had he not feared the scorn of the others, and it was only half-heartedly that they searched—vainly, as it proved—for some portable souvenir to bear away.

It was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and shouted of what he had found. The rest followed him, and looked curiously at the immense carved door with the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. It was, Johansen said, like a great barn-door; and they all felt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around it, though they could not decide whether it lay flat like a trap-door or slantwise like an outside cellar-door. As Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could not be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative position of everything else seemed phantasmally variable.

Briden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then Donovan felt over it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went. He climbed interminably along the grotesque stone moulding—that is, one would call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontal —and the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly, the acre-great lintel began to give inward at the top; and they saw that it was balanced

Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and rejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the monstrously carven portal. In this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in a diagonal way, so that all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upset.

The aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings. The odor rising from the newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared Hawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and everyone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness.

Poor Johansen's handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of the six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant. The Thing cannot be described—there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident. After vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.

Three men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned. God rest them, if there be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan, Guerrera, and Angstrom. Parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of green-crusted rock to the boat, and Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn't have been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only Briden and Johansen reached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous monstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated, floundering at the edge of the water.

Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all hands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down between wheel and engines to get the Alert under way. Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising strokes of cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously.

But Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could surely overtake the Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance; and, setting the engine for full speed, ran lightning-like on deck and reversed the wheel. There was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern of a daemon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but Johansen drove on relentlessly. There was a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of a thousand opened graves, and a sound that the chronicler could not put on paper. For an instant the ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and then there was only a venomous seething astern; where—God in heaven!—the scattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn was nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened every second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam.

That was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side. He did not try to navigate after the first bold flight, for the reaction had taken something out of his soul. Then came the storm of April , and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness. There is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a comets tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and from the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged mocking imps of Tartarus.

Out of that dream came rescue—the Vigilant, the vice-admiralty court, the streets of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the old house by the Egeberg. He could not tell—they would think him mad. He would write of what he knew before death came, but his wife must not guess. Death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories.

That was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box beside the bas-relief and the papers of Professor . With it shall go this record of mine—this test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may never be pieced together again. I have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my life will be long. As my uncle went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cult still lives.

Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men. A time will come—but I must not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if I do not survive this manuscript, my executors may put caution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye.

Here is the link to buy the book, if you’re interested. And, of course, I’d love for you to do so.
 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
[2] And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
[3] And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
[4] And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
[5] But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
[6] Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
[7] And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
[8] And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
[9] And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
[10] And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
[11] And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
[12] And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
[13] And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
[14] And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
[15] And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

WANT TO AMP UP YOUR SEX LIFE? TAKE YOUR VAGINA TO THE GYM

kegel exercises, vaginal weight liftingAt a housewarming party for a close friend last weekend, and while I was getting a glass of red at the wine bar, I met a woman in her 60s who introduced herself as a sex therapist. My writer brain instantly obliterated eighteen years of upbringing on the do’s and don’ts of social pleasantries (“Nice to meet you,” “How do you know the hostess?”), and I blurted out, “Cool! Can I interview you?” She graciously overlooked my enthusiastic gaffe in social etiquette and agreed to chat. We grabbed our wine and found a quiet corner.

When I asked her what issues were most prevalent with today’s couples, she immediately replied, “Diminished sex drive.” She stated that one of the most common complaints she gets from women over 50 is that their libidos have left the building, and apparently, have taken their luggage. Many Boomer women are frustrated with post-menopausal sex drives that have slipped into neutral. Quite frankly, we miss it and we want it back.

We’re aware that we could simply go to Walgreen’s and pick up something from the vast assortment of pills that promise to make us want to nail our husbands and every marginally attractive guy on the street, but even the non-prescription ones report the possibility of hair loss, weight gain, severe depression, facial tics, and strokes. Awesome. Now we’re ready, but hubby has moved to the couch. At his parents’. (And they live in Wyoming.)

She offered a few easy suggestions. Plan a sex night in advance. (For those of you who don’t find that particularly “romantic,” what do you think you were doing when you were dating? You scheduled the date and planned an intimate dinner, then spent the entire week thinking about what to wear and when best to shave your legs. It doesn’t get more planned than that.) Anticipation can be a powerful aphrodisiac. If you’re a wine drinker, drink red wine. Studies show that women who drink 1-2 glasses of red wine per day have increased sex drives (I love this woman). Have more sex. Just do it. Maybe you’re not totally feeling it at that moment, but sometimes mood follows foreplay. Women often report that once they get going, they find themselves thinking “I remember this. I like this. I like this a lot.” Simply put, good sex makes you want more of it. Oh, this was fun. We definitely needed more wine.

Settling back in after our refills, I learned the Big Secret.

There’s something specific that we can do to jack up our lackluster libidos and get them flying their freak flags again. We can strengthen our pelvic floors. Our vaginas have muscles that contract and relax. And like any muscle, they can get out of shape, especially after childbirth (imagine driving a school bus out of a garage built for a Mini Cooper) or menopause (it always comes back to menopause).

A fit vagina does several things:

It increases your libido. A weak vagina is less sensitive than a strong one, and hence, less responsive. Who knew??
You’ll have more, and better orgasms. Do we even need the rest of the list?
It increases sexual confidence. “You want to try what?? Okay, let’s do it, Big Guy.”
It increases stimulation for your partner. We love it when they’re happy.
It reduces or eliminates urinary incontinence issues. Because Depends can never be discreet enough for yoga pants.
It increases circulation and lubrication. We can toss that messy, sticky KY jelly.
It reduces vaginal or pelvic pain during sex. Amen. “GET OFF ME” rarely leads to a satisfactory conclusion for either party.
The health and well-being of your vagina makes the rest of your body healthier. Finally, motivation to work out every day.
You can do your exercises at home. In private. Some things can’t be unseen.
And if you’re really dedicated, you can teach your vagina to shoot ping pong balls and other objects out of your lady parts. This requires experience and practice. But it’s a impressive party trick, especially in front of any 20-somethings, with their pristine, but unnoteworthy lady muscles and their Uggs. Stand back, Daisy Dukes, and let the big girls show you how it’s done.
The concept is similar to traditional Kegel exercises. Contract, hold, release. Contract, hold, release. Keep repeating until your vajayjay gets tired or your mother-in-law walks into the room. But for this version of Kegels, you insert a small glass egg or a light weight up your chute, and Kegel that. Twenty reps a day. Clenching your vaginal muscles strongly enough to internally lift a weighted object works like bicep curls or tricep presses. It makes those muscles work harder and become stronger. My brain was saying, “Oh. My. God. I don’t think so.” But my libido was thinking “Actually, this could work.”

Since I don’t know any personal trainers in town who teach weightlifting for the vagina, I went back to my office and Googled it. Where have I been?? Maybe I’m the last person on the planet to know this, but I found a woman named Kim Anami who teaches “Vagina Kung Fu.” (You can’t make this stuff up.) For a mere $500, you’ll get an in-home, eight-week course where you’ll learn how to “open beer bottles and shoot ping pong balls through the air.” Hubby will never again need a bottle opener and will have bragging rights with all of his fishing buddies. And if your company hosts annual ping pong tournaments, head hunters will be fighting over you for three states in any direction. Upon graduation, you’ll not only be healthier and more amenable to sex, you’ll have the indisputably baddest-ass woo-hoo on the block. 

But wait. It gets even better.

For the truly committed or the overachievers with a competitive streak, check out Tatyana Kozhevnikova, the Guinness world record holder in vaginal weight lifting. This woman can lift a 31 lb. weight. With. Her. Vajayjay. I’m dying to meet her husband. He must be extremely confident, because Ms. Kozhevnikova’s vagina is a formidable thing and would intimidate the hell out of any man with even the slightest insecurities.

So there you have it. An increased libido, better and more frequent sex, no more UPS guys delivering your monthly Depends auto-shipment, and the possibility of becoming a highly sought-after local party attraction. All of this can be yours in just two short months. I’m not sure how this will play out for the over-60 group (which includes me). I’m not even comfortable with low-rise jeans that show butt cracks. A 65-year-old woman projectile launching sports paraphernalia out of her lady bush might not be as hot as it sounds.


Causes of Diarrhea
Although condition of diarrhea is taken lightly by most people, it is a dangerous ailment that can cause death. This ailment is one of the most common causes of infant death in developing countries. Mortality of children is associated with diarrhea in a significant number of cases in developing nation. Poor hygiene practices are the major cause of the ailment (Bostoen et al., 2008). Other factors may cause diarrhea to a less severe extent.

Some species of bacteria are responsible for some of the most severe forms of diarrhea. Vibrio cholerae, a bacterium that thrives in water, causes severe diarrhea that may kill an infant within hours of the onset of the symptoms. A victim of diarrhea suffers loss of water in the body and eventually succumbs to dehydration. Several measures can be undertaken to prevent occurrence of diarrhea and even control the cases that arise (Bostoen et al., 2008).

Risk Factors
A study of over thirty three thousand children revealed that fecal contamination is the leading cause of diarrhea in developing nations. Improper disposal of excreta and lack of necessary disposal facilities are the major factors affecting contamination of water. In some cases, the latrine being used for disposal of excreta was inappropriate or open.

This caused as much harm as open disposal of excreta (Bostoen et al., 2008). An improvement of the method of disposal of excreta was shown to improve the incidence of diarrhea by thirty percent. Although these studies involved observation of trends, they gave a clear indication that proper disposal of human excreta was an effective way to control the rate of occurrence of diarrhea in developing nations.

Once the human excreta are disposed off in an inappropriate manner, there are various ways in which the bacteria contained in it are transmitted to another human individual. Waste may contaminate water, which is then ingested later by an individual. One may come into contact with the excreta and ingest the bacteria during eating or drinking.

When one comes into contact with a person who has contaminated hands through shaking of hands, the bacteria may be passed on. There is only one apparent point of entry of the bacteria into the human body. This is through the oral cavity (Bostoen et al., 2008). After ingestion of the bacteria, it may be passed out in excreta again after multiplication in the gut. If the human waste is disposed off in an inappropriate manner, it may continue to pose a danger of passing on the bacteria to another individual.

The age of the individual exposed to risk is also a significant factor in determining whether diarrhea may occur in the individual. Young people tend to suffer diarrhea more often (Bostoen et al., 2008). Although some organisms can be directly related to diarrhea, it is not possible to know the real cause of the bowel behavior consistent with persistent diarrhea.

When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again going to be a man.

Thus began Zarathustra’s down-going.

2.

Zarathustra went down the mountain alone, no one meeting him. When he entered the forest, however, there suddenly stood before him an old man, who had left his holy cot to seek roots. And thus spake the old man to Zarathustra:

“No stranger to me is this wanderer: many years ago passed he by. Zarathustra he was called; but he hath altered.

Then thou carriedst thine ashes into the mountains: wilt thou now carry thy fire into the valleys? Fearest thou not the incendiary’s doom?

Yea, I recognise Zarathustra. Pure is his eye, and no loathing lurketh about his mouth. Goeth he not along like a dancer?

Altered is Zarathustra; a child hath Zarathustra become; an awakened one is Zarathustra: what wilt thou do in the land of the sleepers?

As in the sea hast thou lived in solitude, and it hath borne thee up. Alas, wilt thou now go ashore? Alas, wilt thou again drag thy body thyself?”

Zarathustra answered: “I love mankind.”

“Why,” said the saint, “did I go into the forest and the desert? Was it not because I loved men far too well?

Now I love God: men, I do not love. Man is a thing too imperfect for me. Love to man would be fatal to me.”

Zarathustra answered: “What spake I of love! I am bringing gifts unto men.”

“Give them nothing,” said the saint. “Take rather part of their load, and carry it along with them—that will be most agreeable unto them: if only it be agreeable unto thee!

If, however, thou wilt give unto them, give them no more than an alms, and let them also beg for it!”

“No,” replied Zarathustra, “I give no alms. I am not poor enough for that.”

The saint laughed at Zarathustra, and spake thus: “Then see to it that they accept thy treasures! They are distrustful of anchorites, and do not believe that we come with gifts.

The fall of our footsteps ringeth too hollow through their streets. And just as at night, when they are in bed and hear a man abroad long before sunrise, so they ask themselves concerning us: Where goeth the thief?

Go not to men, but stay in the forest! Go rather to the animals! Why not be like me—a bear amongst bears, a bird amongst birds?”

“And what doeth the saint in the forest?” asked Zarathustra.

The saint answered: “I make hymns and sing them; and in making hymns I laugh and weep and mumble: thus do I praise God.

With singing, weeping, laughing, and mumbling do I praise the God who is my God. But what dost thou bring us as a gift?”

When Zarathustra had heard these words, he bowed to the saint and said: “What should I have to give thee! Let me rather hurry hence lest I take aught away from thee!”—And thus they parted from one another, the old man and Zarathustra, laughing like schoolboys.

When Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: “Could it be possible! This old saint in the forest hath not yet heard of it, that GOD IS DEAD!”

3.

When Zarathustra arrived at the nearest town which adjoineth the forest, he found many people assembled in the market-place; for it had been announced that a rope-dancer would give a performance. And Zarathustra spake thus unto the people:

I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN. Man is something that is to be surpassed. What have ye done to surpass man?

All beings hitherto have created something beyond themselves: and ye want to be the ebb of that great tide, and would rather go back to the beast than surpass man?

What is the ape to man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And just the same shall man be to the Superman: a laughing-stock, a thing of shame.

Ye have made your way from the worm to man, and much within you is still worm. Once were ye apes, and even yet man is more of an ape than any of the apes.

Even the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid of plant and phantom. But do I bid you become phantoms or plants?

Lo, I teach you the Superman!

The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: The Superman SHALL BE the meaning of the earth!

I conjure you, my brethren, REMAIN TRUE TO THE EARTH, and believe not those who speak unto you of superearthly hopes! Poisoners are they, whether they know it or not.

Despisers of life are they, decaying ones and poisoned ones themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so away with them!

Once blasphemy against God was the greatest blasphemy; but God died, and therewith also those blasphemers. To blaspheme the earth is now the dreadfulest sin, and to rate the heart of the unknowable higher than the meaning of the earth!

Once the soul looked contemptuously on the body, and then that contempt was the supreme thing:—the soul wished the body meagre, ghastly, and famished. Thus it thought to escape from the body and the earth.

Oh, that soul was itself meagre, ghastly, and famished; and cruelty was the delight of that soul!

But ye, also, my brethren, tell me: What doth your body say about your soul? Is your soul not poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency?

Verily, a polluted stream is man. One must be a sea, to receive a polluted stream without becoming impure.

Lo, I teach you the Superman: he is that sea; in him can your great contempt be submerged.

What is the greatest thing ye can experience? It is the hour of great contempt. The hour in which even your happiness becometh loathsome unto you, and so also your reason and virtue.

The hour when ye say: “What good is my happiness! It is poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency. But my happiness should justify existence itself!”

The hour when ye say: “What good is my reason! Doth it long for knowledge as the lion for his food? It is poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency!”

The hour when ye say: “What good is my virtue! As yet it hath not made me passionate. How weary I am of my good and my bad! It is all poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency!”

The hour when ye say: “What good is my justice! I do not see that I am fervour and fuel. The just, however, are fervour and fuel!”

The hour when ye say: “What good is my pity! Is not pity the cross on which he is nailed who loveth man? But my pity is not a crucifixion.”

Have ye ever spoken thus? Have ye ever cried thus? Ah! would that I had heard you crying thus!

It is not your sin—it is your self-satisfaction that crieth unto heaven; your very sparingness in sin crieth unto heaven!

Where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue? Where is the frenzy with which ye should be inoculated?

Lo, I teach you the Superman: he is that lightning, he is that frenzy!—

When Zarathustra had thus spoken, one of the people called out: “We have now heard enough of the rope-dancer; it is time now for us to see him!” And all the people laughed at Zarathustra. But the rope-dancer, who thought the words applied to him, began his performance.

4.

Zarathustra, however, looked at the people and wondered. Then he spake thus:

Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman—a rope over an abyss.

A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting.

What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what is lovable in man is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING.

I love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they are the over-goers.

I love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, and arrows of longing for the other shore.

I love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars for going down and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth of the Superman may hereafter arrive.

I love him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know in order that the Superman may hereafter live. Thus seeketh he his own down-going.

I love him who laboureth and inventeth, that he may build the house for the Superman, and prepare for him earth, animal, and plant: for thus seeketh he his own down-going.

I love him who loveth his virtue: for virtue is the will to down-going, and an arrow of longing.

I love him who reserveth no share of spirit for himself, but wanteth to be wholly the spirit of his virtue: thus walketh he as spirit over the bridge.

I love him who maketh his virtue his inclination and destiny: thus, for the sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live no more.

I love him who desireth not too many virtues. One virtue is more of a virtue than two, because it is more of a knot for one’s destiny to cling to.

I love him whose soul is lavish, who wanteth no thanks and doth not give back: for he always bestoweth, and desireth not to keep for himself.

I love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favour, and who then asketh: “Am I a dishonest player?”—for he is willing to succumb.

I love him who scattereth golden words in advance of his deeds, and always doeth more than he promiseth: for he seeketh his own down-going.

I love him who justifieth the future ones, and redeemeth the past ones: for he is willing to succumb through the present ones.

I love him who chasteneth his God, because he loveth his God: for he must succumb through the wrath of his God.

I love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding, and may succumb through a small matter: thus goeth he willingly over the bridge.

I love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgetteth himself, and all things are in him: thus all things become his down-going.

I love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart: thus is his head only the bowels of his heart; his heart, however, causeth his down-going.

I love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of the dark cloud that lowereth over man: they herald the coming of the lightning, and succumb as heralds.

Lo, I am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of the cloud: the lightning, however, is the SUPERMAN.—

5.

When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he again looked at the people, and was silent. “There they stand,” said he to his heart; “there they laugh: they understand me not; I am not the mouth for these ears.

Must one first batter their ears, that they may learn to hear with their eyes? Must one clatter like kettledrums and penitential preachers? Or do they only believe the stammerer?

They have something whereof they are proud. What do they call it, that which maketh them proud? Culture, they call it; it distinguisheth them from the goatherds.

They dislike, therefore, to hear of ‘contempt’ of themselves. So I will appeal to their pride.

I will speak unto them of the most contemptible thing: that, however, is THE LAST MAN!”

And thus spake Zarathustra unto the people:

It is time for man to fix his goal. It is time for man to plant the germ of his highest hope.

Still is his soil rich enough for it. But that soil will one day be poor and exhausted, and no lofty tree will any longer be able to grow thereon.

Alas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow of his longing beyond man—and the string of his bow will have unlearned to whizz!

I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.

Alas! There cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any star. Alas! There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no longer despise himself.

Lo! I show you THE LAST MAN.

“What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?”—so asketh the last man and blinketh.

The earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth the last man who maketh everything small. His species is ineradicable like that of the ground-flea; the last man liveth longest.

“We have discovered happiness”—say the last men, and blink thereby.

They have left the regions where it is hard to live; for they need warmth. One still loveth one’s neighbour and rubbeth against him; for one needeth warmth.

Turning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful: they walk warily. He is a fool who still stumbleth over stones or men!

A little poison now and then: that maketh pleasant dreams. And much poison at last for a pleasant death.

One still worketh, for work is a pastime. But one is careful lest the pastime should hurt one.

One no longer becometh poor or rich; both are too burdensome. Who still wanteth to rule? Who still wanteth to obey? Both are too burdensome.

No shepherd, and one herd! Every one wanteth the same; every one is equal: he who hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the madhouse.

“Formerly all the world was insane,”—say the subtlest of them, and blink thereby.

They are clever and know all that hath happened: so there is no end to their raillery. People still fall out, but are soon reconciled—otherwise it spoileth their stomachs.

They have their little pleasures for the day, and their little pleasures for the night, but they have a regard for health.

“We have discovered happiness,”—say the last men, and blink thereby.—

And here ended the first discourse of Zarathustra, which is also called “The Prologue”: for at this point the shouting and mirth of the multitude interrupted him. “Give us this last man, O Zarathustra,”—they called out—“make us into these last men! Then will we make thee a present of the Superman!” And all the people exulted and smacked their lips. Zarathustra, however, turned sad, and said to his heart:

“They understand me not: I am not the mouth for these ears.

Too long, perhaps, have I lived in the mountains; too much have I hearkened unto the brooks and trees: now do I speak unto them as unto the goatherds.

Calm is my soul, and clear, like the mountains in the morning. But they think me cold, and a mocker with terrible jests.

And now do they look at me and laugh: and while they laugh they hate me too. There is ice in their laughter.”

6.

Then, however, something happened which made every mouth mute and every eye fixed. In the meantime, of course, the rope-dancer had commenced his performance: he had come out at a little door, and was going along the rope which was stretched between two towers, so that it hung above the market-place and the people. When he was just midway across, the little door opened once more, and a gaudily-dressed fellow like a buffoon sprang out, and went rapidly after the first one. “Go on, halt-foot,” cried his frightful voice, “go on, lazy-bones, interloper, sallow-face!—lest I tickle thee with my heel! What dost thou here between the towers? In the tower is the place for thee, thou shouldst be locked up; to one better than thyself thou blockest the way!”—And with every word he came nearer and nearer the first one. When, however, he was but a step behind, there happened the frightful thing which made every mouth mute and every eye fixed—he uttered a yell like a devil, and jumped over the other who was in his way. The latter, however, when he thus saw his rival triumph, lost at the same time his head and his footing on the rope; he threw his pole away, and shot downwards faster than it, like an eddy of arms and legs, into the depth. The market-place and the people were like the sea when the storm cometh on: they all flew apart and in disorder, especially where the body was about to fall.

Zarathustra, however, remained standing, and just beside him fell the body, badly injured and disfigured, but not yet dead. After a while consciousness returned to the shattered man, and he saw Zarathustra kneeling beside him. “What art thou doing there?” said he at last, “I knew long ago that the devil would trip me up. Now he draggeth me to hell: wilt thou prevent him?”

“On mine honour, my friend,” answered Zarathustra, “there is nothing of all that whereof thou speakest: there is no devil and no hell. Thy soul will be dead even sooner than thy body: fear, therefore, nothing any more!”

The man looked up distrustfully. “If thou speakest the truth,” said he, “I lose nothing when I lose my life. I am not much more than an animal which hath been taught to dance by blows and scanty fare.”

“Not at all,” said Zarathustra, “thou hast made danger thy calling; therein there is nothing contemptible. Now thou perishest by thy calling: therefore will I bury thee with mine own hands.”

When Zarathustra had said this the dying one did not reply further; but he moved his hand as if he sought the hand of Zarathustra in gratitude.

7.

Meanwhile the evening came on, and the market-place veiled itself in gloom. Then the people dispersed, for even curiosity and terror become fatigued. Zarathustra, however, still sat beside the dead man on the ground, absorbed in thought: so he forgot the time. But at last it became night, and a cold wind blew upon the lonely one. Then arose Zarathustra and said to his heart:

Verily, a fine catch of fish hath Zarathustra made to-day! It is not a man he hath caught, but a corpse.

Sombre is human life, and as yet without meaning: a buffoon may be fateful to it.

I want to teach men the sense of their existence, which is the Superman, the lightning out of the dark cloud—man.

But still am I far from them, and my sense speaketh not unto their sense. To men I am still something between a fool and a corpse.

Gloomy is the night, gloomy are the ways of Zarathustra. Come, thou cold and stiff companion! I carry thee to the place where I shall bury thee with mine own hands.

8.

When Zarathustra had said this to his heart, he put the corpse upon his shoulders and set out on his way. Yet had he not gone a hundred steps, when there stole a man up to him and whispered in his ear—and lo! he that spake was the buffoon from the tower. “Leave this town, O Zarathustra,” said he, “there are too many here who hate thee. The good and just hate thee, and call thee their enemy and despiser; the believers in the orthodox belief hate thee, and call thee a danger to the multitude. It was thy good fortune to be laughed at: and verily thou spakest like a buffoon. It was thy good fortune to associate with the dead dog; by so humiliating thyself thou hast saved thy life to-day. Depart, however, from this town,—or tomorrow I shall jump over thee, a living man over a dead one.” And when he had said this, the buffoon vanished; Zarathustra, however, went on through the dark streets.

At the gate of the town the grave-diggers met him: they shone their torch on his face, and, recognising Zarathustra, they sorely derided him. “Zarathustra is carrying away the dead dog: a fine thing that Zarathustra hath turned a grave-digger! For our hands are too cleanly for that roast. Will Zarathustra steal the bite from the devil? Well then, good luck to the repast! If only the devil is not a better thief than Zarathustra!—he will steal them both, he will eat them both!” And they laughed among themselves, and put their heads together.

Zarathustra made no answer thereto, but went on his way. When he had gone on for two hours, past forests and swamps, he had heard too much of the hungry howling of the wolves, and he himself became a-hungry. So he halted at a lonely house in which a light was burning.

“Hunger attacketh me,” said Zarathustra, “like a robber. Among forests and swamps my hunger attacketh me, and late in the night.

“Strange humours hath my hunger. Often it cometh to me only after a repast, and all day it hath failed to come: where hath it been?”

And thereupon Zarathustra knocked at the door of the house. An old man appeared, who carried a light, and asked: “Who cometh unto me and my bad sleep?”

“A living man and a dead one,” said Zarathustra. “Give me something to eat and drink, I forgot it during the day. He that feedeth the hungry refresheth his own soul, saith wisdom.”

The old man withdrew, but came back immediately and offered Zarathustra bread and wine. “A bad country for the hungry,” said he; “that is why I live here. Animal and man come unto me, the anchorite. But bid thy companion eat and drink also, he is wearier than thou.” Zarathustra answered: “My companion is dead; I shall hardly be able to persuade him to eat.” “That doth not concern me,” said the old man sullenly; “he that knocketh at my door must take what I offer him. Eat, and fare ye well!”—

Thereafter Zarathustra again went on for two hours, trusting to the path and the light of the stars: for he was an experienced night-walker, and liked to look into the face of all that slept. When the morning dawned, however, Zarathustra found himself in a thick forest, and no path was any longer visible. He then put the dead man in a hollow tree at his head—for he wanted to protect him from the wolves—and laid himself down on the ground and moss. And immediately he fell asleep, tired in body, but with a tranquil soul.

9.

Long slept Zarathustra; and not only the rosy dawn passed over his head, but also the morning. At last, however, his eyes opened, and amazedly he gazed into the forest and the stillness, amazedly he gazed into himself. Then he arose quickly, like a seafarer who all at once seeth the land; and he shouted for joy: for he saw a new truth. And he spake thus to his heart:

A light hath dawned upon me: I need companions—living ones; not dead companions and corpses, which I carry with me where I will.

But I need living companions, who will follow me because they want to follow themselves—and to the place where I will.

A light hath dawned upon me. Not to the people is Zarathustra to speak, but to companions! Zarathustra shall not be the herd’s herdsman and hound!

To allure many from the herd—for that purpose have I come. The people and the herd must be angry with me: a robber shall Zarathustra be called by the herdsmen.

Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the good and just. Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the believers in the orthodox belief.

Behold the good and just! Whom do they hate most? Him who breaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, the lawbreaker:—he, however, is the creator.

Behold the believers of all beliefs! Whom do they hate most? Him who breaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker—he, however, is the creator.

Companions, the creator seeketh, not corpses—and not herds or believers either. Fellow-creators the creator seeketh—those who grave new values on new tables.

Companions, the creator seeketh, and fellow-reapers: for everything is ripe for the harvest with him. But he lacketh the hundred sickles: so he plucketh the ears of corn and is vexed.

Companions, the creator seeketh, and such as know how to whet their sickles. Destroyers, will they be called, and despisers of good and evil. But they are the reapers and rejoicers.

Fellow-creators, Zarathustra seeketh; fellow-reapers and fellow-rejoicers, Zarathustra seeketh: what hath he to do with herds and herdsmen and corpses!

And thou, my first companion, rest in peace! Well have I buried thee in thy hollow tree; well have I hid thee from the wolves.

But I part from thee; the time hath arrived. ‘Twixt rosy dawn and rosy dawn there came unto me a new truth.

I am not to be a herdsman, I am not to be a grave-digger. Not any more will I discourse unto the people; for the last time have I spoken unto the dead.

With the creators, the reapers, and the rejoicers will I associate: the rainbow will I show them, and all the stairs to the Superman.

To the lone-dwellers will I sing my song, and to the twain-dwellers; and unto him who hath still ears for the unheard, will I make the heart heavy with my happiness.

I make for my goal, I follow my course; over the loitering and tardy will I leap. Thus let my on-going be their down-going!

10.

This had Zarathustra said to his heart when the sun stood at noon-tide. Then he looked inquiringly aloft,—for he heard above him the sharp call of a bird. And behold! An eagle swept through the air in wide circles, and on it hung a serpent, not like a prey, but like a friend: for it kept itself coiled round the eagle’s neck.

“They are mine animals,” said Zarathustra, and rejoiced in his heart.

“The proudest animal under the sun, and the wisest animal under the sun,—they have come out to reconnoitre.

They want to know whether Zarathustra still liveth. Verily, do I still live?

More dangerous have I found it among men than among animals; in dangerous paths goeth Zarathustra. Let mine animals lead me!”

When Zarathustra had said this, he remembered the words of the saint in the forest. Then he sighed and spake thus to his heart:

“Would that I were wiser! Would that I were wise from the very heart, like my serpent!

But I am asking the impossible. Therefore do I ask my pride to go always with my wisdom!

And if my wisdom should some day forsake me:—alas! it loveth to fly away!—may my pride then fly with my folly!”

Thus began Zarathustra’s down-going.






ZARATHUSTRA’S DISCOURSES.





I. THE THREE METAMORPHOSES.
Three metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.

Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load-bearing spirit in which reverence dwelleth: for the heavy and the heaviest longeth its strength.

What is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then kneeleth it down like the camel, and wanteth to be well laden.

What is the heaviest thing, ye heroes? asketh the load-bearing spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.

Is it not this: To humiliate oneself in order to mortify one’s pride? To exhibit one’s folly in order to mock at one’s wisdom?

Or is it this: To desert our cause when it celebrateth its triumph? To ascend high mountains to tempt the tempter?

Or is it this: To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul?

Or is it this: To be sick and dismiss comforters, and make friends of the deaf, who never hear thy requests?

Or is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth, and not disclaim cold frogs and hot toads?

Or is it this: To love those who despise us, and give one’s hand to the phantom when it is going to frighten us?

All these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon itself: and like the camel, which, when laden, hasteneth into the wilderness, so hasteneth the spirit into its wilderness.

But in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second metamorphosis: here the spirit becometh a lion; freedom will it capture, and lordship in its own wilderness.

Its last Lord it here seeketh: hostile will it be to him, and to its last God; for victory will it struggle with the great dragon.

What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to call Lord and God? “Thou-shalt,” is the great dragon called. But the spirit of the lion saith, “I will.”

“Thou-shalt,” lieth in its path, sparkling with gold—a scale-covered beast; and on every scale glittereth golden, “Thou shalt!”

The values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and thus speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: “All the values of things—glitter on me.

All values have already been created, and all created values—do I represent. Verily, there shall be no ‘I will’ any more.” Thus speaketh the dragon.

My brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit? Why sufficeth not the beast of burden, which renounceth and is reverent?

To create new values—that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new creating—that can the might of the lion do.

To create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty: for that, my brethren, there is need of the lion.

To assume the right to new values—that is the most formidable assumption for a load-bearing and reverent spirit. Verily, unto such a spirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey.

As its holiest, it once loved “Thou-shalt”: now is it forced to find illusion and arbitrariness even in the holiest things, that it may capture freedom from its love: the lion is needed for this capture.

But tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which even the lion could not do? Why hath the preying lion still to become a child?

Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea.

Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto life: ITS OWN will, willeth now the spirit; HIS OWN world winneth the world’s outcast.

Three metamorphoses of the spirit have I designated to you: how the spirit became a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.—

Thus spake Zarathustra. And at that time he abode in the town which is called The Pied Cow.






II. THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE.
People commended unto Zarathustra a wise man, as one who could discourse well about sleep and virtue: greatly was he honoured and rewarded for it, and all the youths sat before his chair. To him went Zarathustra, and sat among the youths before his chair. And thus spake the wise man:

Respect and modesty in presence of sleep! That is the first thing! And to go out of the way of all who sleep badly and keep awake at night!

Modest is even the thief in presence of sleep: he always stealeth softly through the night. Immodest, however, is the night-watchman; immodestly he carrieth his horn.

No small art is it to sleep: it is necessary for that purpose to keep awake all day.

Ten times a day must thou overcome thyself: that causeth wholesome weariness, and is poppy to the soul.

Ten times must thou reconcile again with thyself; for overcoming is bitterness, and badly sleep the unreconciled.

Ten truths must thou find during the day; otherwise wilt thou seek truth during the night, and thy soul will have been hungry.

Ten times must thou laugh during the day, and be cheerful; otherwise thy stomach, the father of affliction, will disturb thee in the night.

Few people know it, but one must have all the virtues in order to sleep well. Shall I bear false witness? Shall I commit adultery?

Shall I covet my neighbour’s maidservant? All that would ill accord with good sleep.

And even if one have all the virtues, there is still one thing needful: to send the virtues themselves to sleep at the right time.

That they may not quarrel with one another, the good females! And about thee, thou unhappy one!

Peace with God and thy neighbour: so desireth good sleep. And peace also with thy neighbour’s devil! Otherwise it will haunt thee in the night.

Honour to the government, and obedience, and also to the crooked government! So desireth good sleep. How can I help it, if power like to walk on crooked legs?

He who leadeth his sheep to the greenest pasture, shall always be for me the best shepherd: so doth it accord with good sleep.

Many honours I want not, nor great treasures: they excite the spleen. But it is bad sleeping without a good name and a little treasure.

A small company is more welcome to me than a bad one: but they must come and go at the right time. So doth it accord with good sleep.

Well, also, do the poor in spirit please me: they promote sleep. Blessed are they, especially if one always give in to them.

Thus passeth the day unto the virtuous. When night cometh, then take I good care not to summon sleep. It disliketh to be summoned—sleep, the lord of the virtues!

But I think of what I have done and thought during the day. Thus ruminating, patient as a cow, I ask myself: What were thy ten overcomings?

And what were the ten reconciliations, and the ten truths, and the ten laughters with which my heart enjoyed itself?

Thus pondering, and cradled by forty thoughts, it overtaketh me all at once—sleep, the unsummoned, the lord of the virtues.

Sleep tappeth on mine eye, and it turneth heavy. Sleep toucheth my mouth, and it remaineth open.

Verily, on soft soles doth it come to me, the dearest of thieves, and stealeth from me my thoughts: stupid do I then stand, like this academic chair.

But not much longer do I then stand: I already lie.—

When Zarathustra heard the wise man thus speak, he laughed in his heart: for thereby had a light dawned upon him. And thus spake he to his heart:

A fool seemeth this wise man with his forty thoughts: but I believe he knoweth well how to sleep.

Happy even is he who liveth near this wise man! Such sleep is contagious—even through a thick wall it is contagious.

A magic resideth even in his academic chair. And not in vain did the youths sit before the preacher of virtue.

His wisdom is to keep awake in order to sleep well. And verily, if life had no sense, and had I to choose nonsense, this would be the desirablest nonsense for me also.

Now know I well what people sought formerly above all else when they sought teachers of virtue. Good sleep they sought for themselves, and poppy-head virtues to promote it!

To all those belauded sages of the academic chairs, wisdom was sleep without dreams: they knew no higher significance of life.

Even at present, to be sure, there are some like this preacher of virtue, and not always so honourable: but their time is past. And not much longer do they stand: there they already lie.

Blessed are those drowsy ones: for they shall soon nod to sleep.—

Thus spake Zarathustra.
Let's say you're the king of England in the 13th century. You enjoy absolute power and authority, but only if you can keep your grip on the throne, and there are all sorts of plotting pretenders and rebellious radicals keen on toppling your reign and seeing you dead.

So, what can you do to scare them off? You can't post a bunch of threatening Tweets (heck, the printing press is still a few centuries away). But maybe, just maybe, you can devise a form of punishment so twisted and sadistic that only a lunatic would even entertain the thought of committing high treason.

That's how historians believe medieval monarchs came up with the wildly violent execution method known as hanging, drawing and quartering. If you've seen the film "Braveheart," then you've had a (nauseating) taste of just how torturous and cruel the practice was. The Scottish rebel William Wallace was hanged, drawn and quartered in 1305 (accused of being a traitor to King Edward I) and in the movie we see him disemboweled — his abdomen cut open and his intestines removed — while still very much alive. And that was only one part of the ordeal!

William Wallace, execution
William Wallace (immortalized in the movie "Braveheart") is dragged (or "drawn") to his execution at Smithfield where he will be hanged, disemboweled and quartered, in 1305.
CULTURE CLUB/GETTY IMAGES
From the 13th century all the way until the 19th century, hundreds of Englishmen convicted of high treason were sentenced to die by this very public and grisly display of absolute power, including rebels like Wallace, political terrorists like Guy Fawkes and Catholic martyrs who refused to recognize the authority of the Church of England.

Drawing First, Then Hanging and Quartering
Richard  is the creator of the excellent history website Capital Punishment U.K. and the author of "Capital Punishment in Britain." He says that hanging, drawing and quartering was the "ultimate" punishment, but that the name creates some confusion.

Here's the actual text of the English law (on the books until 1870) outlining the death sentence for anyone convicted of high treason:

"That you be drawn on a hurdle to the place of execution where you shall be hanged by the neck and being alive cut down, your privy members shall be cut off and your bowels taken out and burned before you, your head severed from your body and your body divided into four quarters to be disposed of at the King's pleasure."
The "drawing" part actually comes first, and it involves the convict being tied to a type of sled that's "drawn" or dragged behind a horse all the way from the prison to the gallows. For many centuries, that journey was a full 3 miles from Newgate Prison in London to Tyburn, a remote locale outside of the city whose name became inextricably linked with public executions.

"It was probably a good three-hour drag," says , and the streets would have been packed with riotous crowds jeering and throwing garbage at the poor sap as he prepared to meet his maker in the worst manner possible.

Hanged Until 'Mostly Dead,' Then Comes the Really Bad Part
Fans of "The Princess Bride" know that there's a big difference between being "all dead" and "mostly dead," and so did medieval executioners. After being dragged to Tyburn, the condemned man was hung from a rope (from a gallows or just a tall ladder), but not dropped the necessary distance to snap his neck. After a few terrifying minutes of near-asphyxiation, the man was cut down while only mostly dead.

Boy, did he wish he was all dead! Because what came next was absolute madness. As the law dictated, his "privy members" were cut off first — that means (ahem) his penis and testicles — and tossed in a roaring fire. Next, his abdomen was slit open from groin to sternum and his intestines were pulled out.

"At what point people lost consciousness and died, exactly, we'll never know," says , but if the "de-privying" and disemboweling didn't do the trick, the next part certainly did — the man's heart was cut from his chest and also burned.

Quartering as a Publicity Stunt
In England, the final step of hanging, drawing and quartering was to cut off the condemned man's head and then "quarter" his remaining corpse by carving it into four pieces. According to graphic medieval drawings, that basically meant cutting off the legs and arms.

 says that the severed limbs were parboiled in a blend of spices designed to preserve the flesh for as long as possible. That's because the dead man's body parts would next be taken on a "publicity tour" of sorts to let everyone know what happens to people who challenge the authority of the king.

"One of the main points of doing all of this was to demonstrate the absolute power of the monarchy," says . "Because there was no media or newspapers back then, the quartering could distribute the body parts to the surrounding towns as a warning."

On June 19, 1535, monks of the London Charterhouse were executed at Tyburn. They were drawn, hanged and quartered for refusing to accept King Henry VIII as the supreme head of the Church.

The severed head was the sternest warning sign of all. The heads of prominent traitors like Wallace and Fawkes were placed on spikes on London Bridge or the Tower of London.

What about the practice of quartering a victim's body by tying his limbs to four horses and spurring them to run in four different directions?  says that was never done in England, but there's evidence that the French indulged, at least as torture. In 1610, King Henry IV of France was assassinated and the perpetrator, a man named François Ravaillac, was publicly tortured to reveal his accomplices. In addition to being scourged with hot pincers and molten lead, he was "torn to pieces by four horses," according to a report.

A Contemporary Account of a 1782 Execution
The very first person to be sentenced to hanging, drawing and quartering in England was a pirate named William Maurice in 1241, but there are scant details about his crimes or his execution. Even the famous executions of Wallace and Fawkes lack much information beyond a few surviving illustrations.

But in 1782, a naval clerk named David Tyrie was convicted of high treason for selling information to the French, and this time there were newspapers around to record the event for posterity. Tyrie's execution is believed to be the last time that the three-part death sentence was carried out in full, and it drew a blood-thirsty crowd of 100,000 to the British coastal town of Portsmouth. The Hampshire Chronicle reported Aug. 31, 1782:

"After hanging exactly twenty-two minutes, he was lowered upon the sledge, and the sentence literally put in execution. His head was severed from his body, his heart taken out and burnt, his privities cut off, and his body quartered. He was then put into a coffin and buried among the pebbles by the sea-side; but no sooner had the officers retired, but the sailors dug up the coffin, took out the body, and cut it in a thousand pieces, every one carrying away a piece of his body to shew their messmates on board. A more dreadful, affecting execution was perhaps never seen."
Why The Ugly Practice Ended
Over time,  says, "the more gruesome parts of the punishment were omitted," as with the executions of the five men convicted in the Cato Street Conspiracy in 1820. Although the men were sentenced to be hung, drawn and quartered in the traditional grisly fashion, the sheriff of London didn't want to tie up traffic with a long procession and the executioners devised a more efficient way of choreographing the killings, says .

The five were hung for 30 minutes to ensure they were completely dead. Then they were laid one by one in coffins conveniently placed atop the gallows. At the head of each coffin was a raised block upon which each man's head was removed by a trained surgeon or butcher. In this more "civilized" version of the execution, the severed head was raised to the crowd along with the pronouncement, "This is the head of a traitor," but the rest of the body was left intact.

By the mid-19th century, there just weren't as many acts of rebellion, says , plus Victorian-era Londoners started taking a "not in my backyard" stance on public executions.

"The gentrification of places like Tyburn and Newgate had taken place by then and people didn't want that kind of thing happening in their neighborhood," says . "They no longer found these kinds of horrific punishments something they wanted to see."

In 1870, the sentence of hanging, drawing and quartering was officially removed from English law as part of the Forfeiture Act of 1870.
‘Godly butchery’: the horrifying history of hanging, drawing and quartering
In medieval England, the crime of treason was so heinous, and so against the normal social order, that it required a punishment that would horrify as much as it would deter.  reveals the details of a gruesome method of execution reserved only for the worst of the worst…

In 1241, a man named William Marise, the son of an English nobleman, was convicted of one of the worst crimes it was possible to perpetrate against a nation: piracy. His punishment was to be publicly ripped apart into four pieces.

It was known then as ‘Godly butchery’ or ‘three deaths’. Today, we recognise the gruesome method of execution, unique to England, that is seemingly synonymous with the medieval period as being hanged, drawn and quartered.

Marise, who was executed in 1242, was the first-known person to suffer it. Hanging, drawing and quartering was reserved only for the worst of criminals – the traitors.

Committing treason was even worse than murder since it was said to challenge the God-given order of kingdom and society. The Treason Act of 1351 defined it as conspiracy to kill the sovereign or fighting against the sovereign, among others. Piracy, which was an act directly against a monarch, fit into this definition. And as a direct crime against the monarch, treason had to be punished in the most severe way possible.

So barbaric was the form of execution that it could only be carried out on men, as it was deemed indecent to expose a woman’s body to such treatment. A woman convicted of treason would instead be beheaded or burned at the stake.

Why were people hanged, drawn and quartered?
More than a punishment, the purpose of hanging, drawing and quartering was to establish the boundaries of normal behaviour. The people who deserved such an end were not meant to be seen as human, and the pain, humiliation and brutality was intended to create a distinct separation between the audience and the condemned. The message was that ‘normal’ men would not suffer the three deaths.

These ‘death-tortures’ inflicted pain for so long that they practically became an art-form. This served to justify the state’s decision to carry out such a brutal method of execution and to act as a warning to anyone who might consider violating the social order between country and king.

What happens when you are hanged, drawn and quartered?
Being hanged, drawn and quartered was a multi-pronged process of torture and humiliation, performed in front of large, eager crowds.

First, the condemned man was dragged to their place of execution by horse, perhaps while lashed to hurdle, leaving them covered with painful lacerations before the real agony had even begun. This is one possible meaning of the ‘drawn’, as in drawn by the horse – more on the second possible meaning in a moment.

The second step was hanging: the condemned having a rope tied around the neck before being yanked off the ground, sometimes by use of a pulley. There he would dangle and thrash around helplessly until just before the moment he fell into unconsciousness, at which point he was lowered to the ground and disembowelled in front of the horrified yet morbidly fascinated audience.

This is the second possible meaning of ‘drawn’ – there is a debate amongst historians as to the definition of the term. It could, perhaps, refer to both actions. According to the Chronicle of Lanercost – a history of northern England covering parts of 13th and first half of the 14th centuries – the famed Scottish rebel William Wallace, who was executed in this way suffered the further indignity of having his entrails burned in front of him.

Finally, the unfortunate victim was quartered. Sometimes, this was achieved by tying each limb to a different horse, which were then startled into running in different directions so as to rip the body apart. The sundered corpse was then then displayed on city gates across the country – popular sites for the head included London Bridge and Westminster Hall – to serve both as a warning to would-be traitors and an advertisement of the consequences of betraying your sovereign.

Who are the most famous people to be hanged, drawn and quartered?
William Wallace was not the first person to suffer hanging, drawing and quartering in response to inciting insurrection against the English. The Welsh ruler Dafydd ap Gruffydd suffered the fate of godly butchery in 1283. As with Wallace, his death sentence had also been ordered by Edward I. And Wallace would, by no means, be the last.

Among the ‘great and the good’ to suffer the ‘three deaths’ were Hugh Despenser the Younger, whose 1326 execution following the overthrow of Edward II is immortalised in a Jean Froissart manuscript (main image); several prominent figures of the Peasants’ Revolt in 1381; Francis Dereham, one of courtiers alleged to have dallied with Catherine Howard, fifth of Henry VIII’s six wives; and a number of leading figures in the Babington Plot to assassinate Elizabeth I.

The one who got away was arguably Guy Fawkes, the man at the centre of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. He received this sentence, but managed to escape the most horrific parts.

On 31 January 1606, Fawkes was taken to Westminster to be hanged, drawn and quartered. In the chaotic event, Fawkes’s neck broke when he jumped from the gallows ladder, meaning that his entrails were not publicly removed. He was, however, quartered and his body parts displayed at the “four corners of the kingdom”.

When was hanging, drawing and quartering abolished?
By the 19th century, it was rare for hanging, drawing and quartering to be carried out even when sentenced. That was exemplified in 1839, when some 10,000 Chartists led a massive rebellion in Wales. The leaders were caught and sentenced, but the executions were commuted to transportation to Australia instead.

Hanging, drawing and quartering was abolished altogether thanks to the passage of the Forfeiture Act of 1870, thus ending one of the longest traditions of public executions in history. Given our ongoing fascination with the medieval method of execution, the punishment may be over, but its legacy is far from dead.
weakness and one or more swollen, painful lymph nodes (called buboes). This form usually results from the bite of an infected flea. The bacteria multiply in a lymph node near where the bacteria entered the human body. If the patient is not treated with the appropriate antibiotics, the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body.

Septicemic plague: The incubation period of septicemic plague is poorly defined but likely occurs within days of exposure. Patients develop fever, chills, extreme weakness, abdominal pain, shock, and possibly bleeding into the skin and other organs. Skin and other tissues may turn black and die, especially on fingers, toes, and the nose. Septicemic plague can occur as the first symptom of plague or may develop from untreated bubonic plague. This form results from bites of infected fleas or from handling an infected animal.

Pneumonic plague: The incubation period of pneumonic plague is usually just 1 to 3 days. Patients develop fever, headache, weakness, and a rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and sometimes bloody or watery mucous. Pneumonic plague may develop from inhaling infectious droplets or may develop from untreated bubonic or septicemic plague after the bacteria spread to the lungs. The pneumonia may cause respiratory failure and shock. Pneumonic plague is the most serious form of the disease and is the only form of plague that can be spread from person to person (by infectious droplets).

Plague is a serious illness. If you are experiencing symptoms like those listed here, seek immediate medical attention. Prompt treatment with the correct medications is critical to prevent complications or death.

General Discussion
Plague is an acute, severe infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The bacterium is found in fleas and wild rodents such as rats, squirrels, chipmunks or prairie dogs. Plague is a zoonotic disease, which means it can be transmitted to humans through animals, most often through the bites of fleas or through direct contact with infected animal tissue. The disease is most common in parts of Africa and Asia but it also occurs in some areas of the western United States. Symptoms can include an abrupt onset of chills, fever, and enlarged, painful lymph nodes (buboes). Treatment must start immediately to avoid life-threatening complications. Although plague is extremely rare in the United States, interest in the infection has heightened in recent years because of its potential use as an agent of biological warfare.

Signs & Symptoms
The symptoms of plague vary greatly depending upon the specific form that develops. The main clinical forms of plague are: bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic.

Bubonic Plague
Bubonic plague is the most common form of the disease. Symptoms usually develop 2-6 days after exposure to the bacterium and include the sudden onset of fever, chills, weakness, headaches, muscle pain and a general feeling of discomfort or ill health (malaise). An infected individual develops a bubo – a tender, inflamed swelling of a lymph node. Buboes are firm and often very painful. The lymph nodes of the groin, armpit (axilla) or neck are most often involved. Some individuals may experience gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain.

If untreated, the bacteria can spread from the affected lymph node to the bloodstream (septicemia) and the lungs (pneumonia) and cause toxicity, shock, and other life-threatening complications.

Pneumonic Plague
Pneumonic plague is infection of the lungs by the Yersinia pestis bacterium. It can occur as a complication of bubonic plague in which the bacteria spread to the lungs through the bloodstream, or as a primary infection in which the bacterium is inhaled directly into the lungs.
Affected individuals can develop a wide variety of symptoms including fever, chills, a rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, cough, chest pain, severe headaches and the coughing up of bloody sputum (hemoptysis). Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain may also occur. If untreated, this form of plague can rapidly progress to multiple organ failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately death.

Septicemic Plague
This form of plague is characterized by massive growth of bacteria in the blood. It can occur as bacteria in the lymph nodes (bubonic plague) spread to the bloodstream, or as a primary infection (no swollen lymph nodes). Affected individuals may develop prominent gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Other general symptoms may include high fever, chills, exhaustion, headache, and muscle pain (myalgia). Septicemic plague progresses rapidly and can quickly cause life-threatening complications if not diagnosed and treated promptly.

Causes
Plague is caused by infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis. This bacterium is found in wild rodents and their fleas. Some of the most commonly infected rodents are rats, squirrels, chipmunks or prairie dogs. Rabbits and hares (lagomorphs) may also carry the bacteria. The disease is most often transmitted to humans by the bite of infected fleas. Less frequently, direct contact with infectious animal tissue can also result in infection.

Pneumonic plague is the only manifestation of plague that can be transmitted from one person to another. This transmission occurs when a person breathes in (inhales) droplets from a coughing pneumonic plague patient. However, human-to-human transmission is extremely rare and has not been demonstrated in the United States since 1924. Domestic cats can acquire pneumonic plague and transmit the infection to their owners or attending veterinarians in the same manner. Dogs can also acquire infection and may transmit it to humans. The source of a recent human plague outbreak in Colorado was a dog with pneumonic plague.

In recent years, plague has regained notoriety as a potential agent of bioterrorism. Most researchers believe that if used in such a manner, the bacteria would most likely be released as an aerosol with the intent of causing an outbreak of pneumonic plague.

Affected Populations
Plague affects both males and females; however, historically it is slightly more common among men. Men may be more likely to become infected with plague because they are more likely to engage in outdoor activities that put them at risk (http://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html). Seven human plague cases are reported on average in the United States each year. Most cases in the United States occur in the Western and Southwestern part of the country, especially in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, Oregon, Nevada, and California (http://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html). Plague has a scattered worldwide distribution. Most cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa, but plague still occurs on most continents. Historically, plague has caused massive epidemics, most notably the Black Death of the Middle Ages.

Related Disorders
Symptoms of the following disorders can be similar to those of the plague. Comparisons may be useful for a differential diagnosis.

Tularemia is a rare infectious disease, caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis, which most often affects small mammals such as rabbits, rodents and hares. It is highly infectious and is most often transmitted to humans by handling infected animal tissues or by infected tick or biting fly bite. Direct human-to-human transmission has not been documented. The severity of tularemia varies greatly. Some cases are mild and self-limiting; others may have serious complications, and a small percentage (about 2 percent) may become life-threatening. (For more information on this disorder, choose “tularemia” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)

Cat-scratch disease (also commonly known as cat-scratch fever) is a self- limiting infectious disease characterized by swelling and pain in the lymph nodes (regional lymphadenitis). Symptoms can vary from mild to severe, and may include achiness and discomfort (malaise), and/or loss of appetite (anorexia). The disease is caused by the bacterium Bartonella henselae and, in most cases, occurs as a result of a scratch, bite, or lick from a cat or kitten. Symptoms may not appear for several days after exposure and may last for several weeks. Although cat-scratch disease usually subsides without treatment, antibiotic and/or antimicrobial therapy may speed recovery. (For more information on this disorder, choose “bartonellosis” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)

There are numerous other infections that cause similar symptoms to plague including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, lymphatic filariasis, brucellosis, dengue virus disease, and streptococcal lymphadenitis. (For more information on this disorder, choose the specific disorder name as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of plague may be confirmed by specialized laboratory tests in addition to characteristic clinical findings. Yersinia pestis can be identified in blood samples, tissue taken from enlarged lymph nodes (buboes) and sputum. All suspected cases of plague in the United States must be reported to the appropriate local and/or state health department, which in turn notifies the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Standard Therapies
Treatment
The treatment of plague must begin as soon as possible to avoid serious life-threatening complications.

Streptomycin, doxycycline (and other tetracyclines), and fluoroquinolones levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat plague. Gentamicin has also been used successfully to treat plague; chloramphenicol may be indicated in rare cases of plague meningitis. In addition, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin are approved by the FDA to prevent plague in exposed individuals (http://www.cdc.gov/plague/healthcare/clinicians.html).

When pneumonia has developed, droplet precautions should be taken by health care providers to prevent transmission. There is no commercially available vaccine against plague in the United States.

Individuals living in plague endemic areas should take preventive measures such as avoiding contact with rodents and fleas.
Synonyms of Necrotizing Fasciitis
flesh-eating bacteria
flesh-eating disease
streptococcal gangrene
suppurative fasciitis
General Discussion
Necrotizing fasciitis () is a rare infection that means “decaying infection of the fascia,” which is the soft tissue that is part of the connective tissue system that runs throughout the body.  is caused by one or more bacteria that attacks the skin, the tissue just beneath the skin (subcutaneous tissue), and the fascia causing these tissues to die (necrosis). These infections can be sudden, vicious, and fast-spreading. If not treated quickly with antibiotics and/or debridement of the infected tissue, the patient may develop toxic shock syndrome or toxic shock-like syndrome, which may lead to multiple organ failure and death.

Signs & Symptoms
Early symptoms of  are often mistaken for the flu. They include high fever, sore throat, stomach ache, nausea, diarrhea, chills, and general body aches. Around the same time, patients may notice redness (erythema) and pain or tenderness around the red area. The red area often occurs at the infection point, which may include surgical sites, a cut, scratch, bruise, boil, site of medication or drug injection, or any small injury that could have occurred during daily life. The affected area may also spread from the infection point quickly, sometimes spreading at a rate of an inch an hour.

If  progresses to show advanced symptoms, the patient will continue to have a very high fever (over 104 degrees Fahrenheit) or may become hypothermic (low temperature) and become dehydrated. The pain in the infected area becomes constant and piercing, much more severe than the original injury would dictate. The infected area may appear bright red, shiny, swollen, and very hot to the touch. As the infection progresses, the affected area will continue to swell, become purple or mottled (blotches of black, purple, and red), and may be accompanied by a rash of blisters and this is a sign of skin necrosis. The affected area may become hard due to the swelling/inflammation caused by the infection (induration). Although the pain becomes excruciating over the initial 12-48 hours, a very late sign of infection is sudden improvement in pain or lack of sensation in the affected area. This may occur as the nerves to the area begin to die. The patient may have extremely low blood pressure (hypotension) and a faint, rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), which results in dizziness, weakness, and confusion.

If  progresses to show critical symptoms, the patient’s confusion and weakness will become pronounced and the patient may become delirious. S/he may repeatedly lose consciousness and the infected area will swell to several times the normal size. On occasion, the swollen area may split open and release large amounts of thin, cloudy drainage fluid. Large blisters (bullae) filled with a bloody or yellowish fluid and blackened necrotic lesions appear, causing the skin to break open. The pain, slowly subsides as nerves are destroyed, causing a lack of sensation (anesthesia). Urine output ceases (anuria), blood pressure drops severely, heart rate continues to be rapid and shallow, and breathing becomes rapid (tachypnea). Eventually, the patient’s vital organs (kidneys, liver, lungs, etc) shut down due to toxic shock. The skin and other tissues continue to blacken as they die and may shed from the body. Death is imminent.

Causes
 is caused by a bacterium (monomicrobial ) or several bacteria (polymicrobial ) infecting the tissue just beneath the skin (subcutaneous tissue). The bacteria or bacterium enter into the body either via an external injury (surgical sites, a cut, scratch, bruise, boil, or any small injury) or via direct spread from a punctured / perforated internal organ (particularly the colon, rectum, or anus) or sexual organ. Upon infection, the bacteria or bacterium spreads via the fascia, producing endo-toxins (toxins released as the bacteria die and break apart or are lysed) and exo-toxins (toxins released by bacteria as waste) that restricts blood supply to tissue (tissue ischemia), digestion of cells by enzymes resulting in a lesion consisting of pus and the fluid remains of dead tissue, and often systemic illness (disease of any major organ system or any condition that ultimately affects the whole body). Because blood supply to these tissues becomes impaired, neither antibiotics nor the body’s own mechanisms to fight infection are able to reach these tissues. As such, treatment requires surgical debridement (surgical removal of dead and infected tissue).

Given the prevalence of all the bacteria that cause , it is important to ensure external wounds are kept clean to minimize infection. This can be done using alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or by simply using soap and water.

The rest of this section highlights the different bacteria known to cause .

Group A Streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes)
Group A Strep bacteria are among the most common causes of . These Gram-positive bacteria are commonly carried by humans in our noses, throats, and skin without showing any symptoms. There are over 100 types (serotypes) of Group A strep. Strep is the bacteria that causes strep throat. However, when it penetrates into the body, it can cause necrotizing fasciitis. When Group A Strep causes , it can occur together with Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (STSS), which accelerates the speed and deadliness of the infection.

Staphylococcus Aureus
Staphylococcus Aureus bacteria are becoming a more common cause of . Similar to Strep, these Gram-positive bacteria are commonly carried by humans on our skin or noses without showing any symptoms. Staph bacteria can cause boils and food poisoning. Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) is a strain of these bacteria that is a major source of hospital-acquired infections but has become increasingly common in the community over the last decade. It is also frequently found in communal areas such as locker rooms, dormitories, and nursing homes. Its resistance to antibiotics presents a concern during treatment, but specific antibiotics are available to treat MRSA.

Klebsiella
Klebsiella are Gram-negative bacteria commonly found in nature. They are known to cause pneumonia, urinary tract infections, as well as .

Escherichia coli
Escherichia coli are Gram-negative bacteria often found in the large intestine. Most are harmless, but have been known to cause food poisoning. Most strains are helpful for humans when confined to our large intestine (colon), as they provide vitamin K and prevent harmful bacteria from establishing in the intestines. However, E. Coli outside of the intestine can cause infection, including .

Bacteroides
Bacteroides are anaerobic (can survive without oxygen) Gram-negative bacteria that are normally found in the mouth, intestines, and genitals. These bacteria are usually benefit humans by preventing serious pathogens from colonizing the gut. However, when bacteroides infect the fascia (e.g., via a perforated bowel),  can result.

Clostridium
Clostridium are anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria that are commonly found in soil, as well as the intestines of humans and animals. Clostridium botulinum is a bacteria that causes botulism, but there are many other types of Clostridium, including Clostridium perfringens,
Clostridium histolylicum, Clostridium septicum, and Clostridium sordellii. These bacteria are not as common causes of , but have been known to cause  and gas gangrene.

Pseudomonas
Pseudomonas are Gram-negative bacteria that are widespread in nature. They cause many infections, including skin infections and pneumonia.  infections caused by Pseudomonas usually occur in patients with compromised immune systems.

Prevotella
Prevotella are Gram-negative bacteria that exist throughout the body, usually without causing symptoms.  infections caused by Prevotella often occur together with other bacteria and usually target the mouth, jaw, neck, and face.

Affected Populations
Conditions and behaviors that increase the prevalence of poly-microbial  include obesity, poorly controlled or untreated diabetes, chronic kidney failure, HIV, alcohol abuse, abscess, IV drug use, blunt or penetrating trauma, insect bites, surgical incisions, indwelling catheters, chicken pox, vesicles, and (rarely) perforation of the gastrointestinal tract (Sarani et al). However, everybody is susceptible to .

Related Disorders
Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infection (NSTI)
 is a type of NSTI. NSTIs encompass all forms of diseases that involve necrotizing infection of soft tissue. This terminology is being encouraged by doctors since all NSTIs require a similar approach to diagnosis and treatment regardless of location or depth of infection on the body. Diseases that fall under NSTI include: necrotizing adipositis or necrotizing cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, necrotizing myositis.

NSTI Caused by Vibrio Vulnificus (VV)
VV causes symptoms similar to other NSTIs. It is classified by some experts as an NSTI, although this is not universally agreed upon. VV is a bacterium found in warm sea water and can infect people in a similar fashion to other bacteria (through wounds). Aside from exposure to marine life, people with moderate to severe liver disease (particularly chronic hepatitis B infection) are at risk for infection by VV. If not caught and treated early, multi-system organ failure can develop within 24 hours, followed by death.

Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) and Streptococcal TSS or Toxic Shock-Like Syndrome (TSLS)
TSS and TSLS occurs when a patient is infected with a bacteria (often staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes) and succumbs to the exo-toxins and endo-toxins released by the bacteria. It is a complication of NSTIs and needs to be treated quickly with antibiotics, fluid management, and when needed, vasopressors. TSS or TSLS is diagnosed based on strict criteria defined by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Symptoms typically include high fever, low blood pressure, rashes, vomiting, diarrhea, kidney failure, low platelet counts, and confusion.

Mucormycosis
Mucormycosis is an infection caused by mucorales fungi, which are found in bread and fruit mold. If rarely infects humans, but can infect those who are immunocompromised (e.g., severe burn victims or those suffering complications from diabetes, HIV, or leukemia). Symptoms of mucormycosis mimic those of , including rapid spread of soft tissue necrosis and blisters. Similar to , mucormycosis requires prompt diagnosis and similar treatment to save patients. It is known to affect the sinuses and soft palate, and can spread very quickly to the brain, often with fatal results. Standard antibiotics have no activity against mucormycosis because this organism responds to antifungal agents only.

Brown Recluse Spider Bite
Bites from the brown recluse spider (also known as the fiddle back or loxosceles reclusa) can be confused with . The bites are rarely fatal, but cause severe pain and localized skin and soft tissue necrosis, rashes, lethargy, fever, and chills, similar to  symptoms. Treatment for these bites requires antibiotic therapy and wound care.

Diagnosis
Diagnosing  early and quickly is vital to improving survival. However, studies have shown that since it is so rare (on average, doctors see 2 cases of  during their lifetime), misdiagnosis is common. As such, patients and doctors should have a high index of suspicion and ask to eliminate  as a diagnosis as soon as possible.

Once at the hospital, patients will have laboratory testing performed. Often, patients will have white blood cell counts greater than 15,400 cells/mm3 or a sodium level lower than 135 mmol/L. While doctors and scientists have tried to develop Laboratory Risk Indicators for Necrotizing Fasciitis score to predict if a patient has , this scoring tool has yet to be validated in large scale studies.

Apart from clinical diagnosis based on presenting symptoms (i.e., doctor’s initial opinion based on his/her experience and observations), doctors have two options to help diagnose . The first is radiographic testing (e.g., X-Ray, CT scans, and MRIs). X-Rays tend to be a poor choice of diagnostic testing as it only shows air trapped under the skin (subcutaneous emphysema), which is only present in a small proportion of  patients. CT scans are readily available and do a good job of helping doctors diagnose  because it can show inflammatory changes, such as accumulation of fluid (edema), thickening, or collection of pus (abscesses) in the fascia, in addition to gas formation. MRIs are less available and often difficult to administer to patients in critical or unstable condition, often leading to a delay in diagnosis. However, they also effectively help doctors diagnose  by showing soft-tissue or fascial thickening.

The second option is the gold standard in diagnosing  i.e. exploratory surgery where it is common to find “dishwater” or foul-smelling discharge, necrosis or lack of bleeding, and loss of the normal resistance of the fascia to finger dissection. Intra-operative biopsy with Gram stain can be used in some cases but not necessary as findings from the exploratory surgery are often definitive.

Upon diagnosing , doctors will often perform tissue cultures on the infected tissue to determine the bacteria that is causing the infection. However, beginning  treatment before the results of the cultures are available (often ~3 days after culture) is essential.

Standard Therapies
Treatment
Upon arriving at the hospital, it is important for doctors to assess the situation and determine which treatments to begin first to best suit the patient. Discussing treatments for additional complications (like toxic shock syndrome) from  is beyond the scope of this document. This section will focus on describing therapies to treat  specifically: surgical debridement, antibiotic therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and IV immune globulin () therapy.

Surgical Debridement
Surgical debridement is the cornerstone of treatment for . It is the removal of dead, damaged, or infected tissue to allow the remaining healthy tissue to heal more effectively. Many studies have shown that the timing and adequacy of the initial debridement has the biggest impact on mortality. Multiple debridements are often needed as the infection is rarely eliminated after a single surgery. On average, three debridements spaced 12 to 36 hours apart are needed to control the infection. Often, entire muscle groups are infected and must be removed by the surgeon. The surgeon must remove all tissues and structures that are dead or infected to control the infection and prevent spread of the infection to vital organs (usually in the torso), sometimes resulting in removal of significant amounts of tissue or even limbs.

After surgery, the wounds should be left open and treated with wet-to-dry dressings (or “packing”). There is little evidence that using enzymatic debriding agents or caustic solutions, such as dilute sodium hypochlorite (bleach), iodine solutions (eg, Betadine), or antibiotic solutions have any use in post-surgery care. Recently, there have been some studies suggesting that using a system that continuously instills and suctions out salt solutions or low grade enzymatic solutions in a wound may help speed up control of the infection after debridement. Vacuum-assisted closure devices maybe useful in treating large wounds once infection is controlled, but there have not been significant studies in  patients showing improvement in wound management or healing from use of these devices. Upon confirmation that no more surgeries are required, skin grafts and/or plastic surgery may be required to fully close the wounds.

Antibiotic Therapy
Since antibiotics cannot penetrate into the necrotic infected tissue, surgical debridement is the first priority of treatment. However, antibiotic therapy is essential in helping to control sepsis and prevent the further spread of the infection. The recommended course of treatment is the use of vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin to treat MRSA and gram-positive bacteria, an agent to treat anaerobic bacteria (e.g., clindamycin or metronidazole), and an agent to treat gram-negative bacteria. Alternatively, anaerobic and gram-negative bacteria can be treated with one drug that covers both.

While there is increasing resistance to clindamycin, it should still be used as it inhibits production of bacterial endo- and exo-toxins. Quinolones, as well as piperacillin / tazobactam, imipenem, or meropenem are often used to cover gram-negative organisms also.

Although there have been no studies to determine the appropriate length of antibiotic therapy, current best practices continue antibiotic treatment until no additional surgical debridement is needed and the patient is no longer showing signs of systemic inflammation.

Common combinations of antibiotic therapies include:
1. Vancomycin, Clindamycin, and Piperacillin/ tazobactam
2. Linezolid and Piperacillin/tazobactam

Vancomycin may be replaced with daptomycin. Piperacillin/tazobactam may be replaced with imipenem or meropenem. Clindamycin is recommended because of its ability to inhibit toxin production in Streptococcal (gram positive) infections.

Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) Therapy
Use of HBO is controversial to treat  and has not been proven using adequate large-scale clinical studies in humans. Use of HBO therapy for  is based on animal and human studies showing that hyperbaric conditions inhibit infection and exo-toxin production by clostridia. Animal studies have shown mortality reductions with HBO in clostridial . While HBO may be an effective treatment for  in conjunction with antibiotics and surgical debridement, it should be used with careful consideration of the risk-benefit proposition for the patient. Some considerations include the fact that Clostridial  is not common, and use of HBO means moving a patient out of intensive care where emergency intervention can be provided safely and quickly (this is not the case during HBO therapy).

IV immune globulin () therapy
Immune globulins are antibodies (proteins) that are found in blood or other bodily fluids of animals. They are used by the immune system to fight foreign objects like bacteria and viruses.  therapy is not an FDA-approved therapy for  and its use and effectiveness are controversial. Use of  therapy is based on the theory that  can bind to exo-toxins released by staphylococci and streptococci, limiting damage by these toxins. This has been confirmed in some small clinical trials, but these trials have not been extensively done in large populations. If used, IV immune globulin should be restricted to critically ill patients with either staphylococcal or streptococcal  whose exo-toxins  therapy may control
Not Bruce and the gang! Probably the most famous torture device of the Middle Ages, the Iron Maiden was an iron coffin, featuring a maudlin face, into which the poor victim was thrown. Seems bad enough already but throw in a series of spikes pointing inwards at the victim which get closer and stabbier as the coffin is shut and you can imagine why it was so horrid!

The reason that this most famous of devices receives a dishonourable mention is that it didn’t exist in the medieval period! The Iron Maiden was a 19th century hoax created to present the past as being more violent than the modern era to demonstrate the march of progress.
 
7: The Rack

The rack is the classic torture tool of the Spanish Inquisition. Compared to other medieval devices, this one is simple: the victim is tied to a wooden structure featuring a system of cranks. As the cranks are turned, the ropes restraining the victim tighten and the victim’s limbs are stretched. This has the immediate effect of causing great pain!

6: The Thumb Screw

Maybe not as lethal as other methods of torture, but this is certainly one to make you wince! The thumb screw is less a screw a more of a vice. Two metal plates with a vice mechanism into which the victim’s thumb is placed. The vice is then tightened. No further detail necessary…

5: Dunking

The method most often depicted as used to torture suspected witches, dunking is exactly what you would expect: the victim is submerged in water and then removed before drowning. This might not seem so bad but remember, you have no control over when you’re taken out of the water! You could be close to running out of breath or even on the verge of drowning before the torturer lets you back out!

4: The Boot
Sometimes known as the Spanish Boot or the scarpines, the boot was something like a rack for your legs. The lower legs would be placed into a set of tightly fitted wooden or iron boots. Problems really begin when wooden wedges are inserted between the boot and the victim’s skin. Mallets are then used to drive the wedges in causing abrasions, lesions and, ultimately, the breaking of bones.

Some versions would also feature inward pointing spikes, nails or blades to worsen the effect. Not exactly the kind of boots you want to pick up in the January sales!

3: The Breaking Wheel

You may wonder how anything can get worse than this one. The breaking wheel is a wagon wheel with teeth or cogs, onto which the victim is tied so that their limbs rest between the cogs. The torturer then takes a hammer and proceeds to smash different parts of limbs over the wheel. Once the victim was dead, the wheel would be raised up on a shaft for all to see.

Or, the victim could be tied to the outside of the wheel with their feet tied to the ground. The wheel would then be turned until the victim’s body broke, effectively like a more severe version of the rack!

2: Flaying
Flaying has been a method of torture for millennia: the ancient Assyrians and is also depicted as the method of execution of Saint Bartholomew. Basically, the technique involves skinning the victim alive. I don’t think we need to add any more detail.

1: Rat Torture
Rat torture is so awful that it’s difficult to comprehend how someone could have thought it up in the first place. First, the victim is bound to a table or rack. Next, a rat is placed onto their chest. Over the rat is placed a bucket which is then secured so that rat cannot escape. Finally, a fire is placed on top of the bucket. The rat begins to panic and tries to escape. It can’t burrow through the steel bucket so…

Our Half Term Crime and Punishment event is much gentler, with no rats in sight or boots for you to try on. We may have a thumb screw but we won’t force you to try it out for yourself..!!
What is diarrhea?
Diarrhea is when your stools are loose and watery. You may also need to go to the bathroom more often.

Diarrhea is a common problem. It may last 1 or 2 days and goes away on its own.

If diarrhea lasts more than 2 days it may mean you have a more serious problem.

Diarrhea may be either:

Short-term (acute). Diarrhea that lasts 1 or 2 days and goes away. This may be caused by having food or water that was made unsafe by a bacterial infection. Or it may happen if you get sick from a virus.
Long-term (chronic). Diarrhea that lasts several weeks. This may be caused by another health problem such as irritable bowel syndrome. It can also be caused by an intestinal disease such as Crohn’s disease or celiac disease. Some infections such as parasites can cause chronic diarrhea.
What causes diarrhea?
Diarrhea may be caused by many things, including:

A bacterial infection
A virus
Trouble digesting certain things (food intolerance)
Food allergy (such as celiac disease, gluten allergy)
Parasites that enter the body through food or water
A reaction to medicines
An intestinal disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease
A problem with how your stomach and bowels work (functional bowel disorder), such as irritable bowel syndrome
A result of surgery on the stomach or gall bladder
Recent antibiotic use
Metabolic conditions such as thyroid problems
Other less common reasons such as damage from radiation treatments or tumors that make too many hormones
Many people get traveler's diarrhea. This happens when you have food or water that is not safe because of bacteria, parasites, and even food poisoning.

Severe diarrhea may mean you have a serious disease. See your healthcare provider if your symptoms don’t go away or if they keep you from doing your daily activities. It may be hard to find out what is causing your diarrhea.

What are the symptoms of diarrhea?
Each person’s symptoms may vary. Symptoms of diarrhea may include:

Belly (abdominal) cramps
Stomach pain
Swelling (bloating)
Upset stomach (nausea)
Urgent need to go to the bathroom
Fever
Bloody stools
Loss of body fluids (dehydration)
Leaking stool and not being able to control your bowels (incontinence)
Dehydration is a serious side effect of diarrhea. Symptoms include:

Feeling thirsty
Not urinating as often
Having dry skin as well as a dry mouth and nostrils (mucous membranes)
Feeling very tired
Feeling that you may pass out or faint (lightheaded)
Headaches
Fast heart rate
Sunken fontanelle (soft spot) on baby's head
Diarrhea symptoms may look like other health problems.  Bloody diarrhea is always a concern. Always see your doctor to be sure. Be sure to tell the doctor about any bleeding, fever, or vomiting.

How is diarrhea diagnosed?
To see if you have diarrhea, your healthcare provider will give you a physical exam and ask about your past health. You may also have lab tests to check your blood and urine.

Other tests may include:

Stool studies including culture and other tests. This test checks for any abnormal bacteria in your digestive tract that may cause diarrhea and other problems. To do this, a small stool sample is taken and sent to a lab.
Sigmoidoscopy. This test lets your healthcare provider check the inside of part of your large intestine. It helps to tell what is causing diarrhea. A short, flexible, lighted tube (sigmoidoscope) is put into your intestine through the rectum. This tube blows air into your intestine to make it swell. This makes it easier to see inside. A biopsy can be taken if needed.
Colonoscopy. This test looks at the full length of your large intestine. It can help check for any abnormal growths, tissue that is red or swollen, sores (ulcers), or bleeding. A long, flexible, lighted tube (colonoscope) is put into your rectum up into the colon. This tube lets your healthcare provider see the lining of your colon and take out a tissue sample (biopsy) to test it. He or she can also treat some problems that may be found.
Imaging tests. These tests can see if there are any problems with the way your organs are formed (structural abnormalities).
Fasting tests. These tests show if you are unable to digest certain foods (food intolerance). They can also tell if certain foods bring on an immune system reaction (food allergy).
Blood tests. These can look for metabolic problems like thyroid disease, anemia (low blood count), evidence of low vitamin levels suggesting poor absorption, and celiac disease, among other things.
How is diarrhea treated?
Your healthcare provider will make a care plan for you based on:

Your age, overall health, and past health
How serious your case is
How well you handle certain medicines, treatments, or therapies
If your condition is expected to get worse
What you would like to do
In most cases you will need to replace the fluids you have lost.

You may also need a medicine that fights infection (antibiotic) if a bacterial infection is causing your diarrhea.

Complications of diarrhea
If your diarrhea is not treated you are at risk for dehydration. Severe dehydration can lead to organ damage, shock, and fainting (loss of consciousness) or coma.
Can diarrhea be prevented?
Having good personal habits can keep you from getting diarrhea caused by bacteria or a virus. It is important to:

Wash your hands often
Use alcohol based sanitizers
Eat foods that have been cleaned and cooked in a safe way
Not take any foods or liquids that may have been infected with a bacteria or virus
When you are traveling, make sure anything you eat and drink is safe. This is even more important if you travel to developing countries.

Travel safety tips for water and other liquids include:

Not drinking tap water or using it to brush your teeth
Not using ice made from tap water
Not drinking milk or milk items that have not gone through a process to kill certain bacteria (pasteurization)
Travel safety tips for food include:

Not eating any fresh or raw fruits and vegetables unless you wash and peel them yourself
Making sure all meat and fish have been cooked to at least medium doneness
Not eating raw or rare-cooked meat or fish
Making sure meat and shellfish such as shrimp, crab, and scallops, are hot when served
Not eating food from street vendors or food trucks
Living with diarrhea
In most cases diarrhea is a short-term problem. Often it only lasts for a few days. Be sure to take plenty of liquids when you’re having a bout of diarrhea.

Some health problems can make diarrhea last longer or keep coming back. These include inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. If another health problem is causing your diarrhea, follow your healthcare provider’s advice for treating that problem.

When should I call my healthcare provider?
Call your healthcare provider if:

You have diarrhea more often
You have a greater amount of diarrhea
You have symptoms of dehydration. You may feel thirsty, tired, or dizzy. You may also have less urine, or a dry mouth.
You have diarrhea with rectal bleeding or black and tarry stools, a fever, or are vomiting
Key points about diarrhea
Diarrhea is when your stools are loose and watery.
You may also need to go to the bathroom more often.
Short-term (acute) diarrhea lasts 1 or 2 days.
Long-term (chronic) diarrhea lasts several weeks.
Diarrhea symptoms may include belly cramps and an urgent need to go to the bathroom.
Loss of fluids (dehydration) is one of the more serious side effects.
Treatment usually involves replacing lost fluids.
You may need an infection-fighting medicine (antibiotic) if a bacterial infection is the cause.
Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath,
According as he foldeth him around:
For when before him comes th' ill fated soul,
It all confesses; and that judge severe
Of sins, considering what place in hell
Suits the transgression, with his tail so oft
Himself encircles, as degrees beneath
He dooms it to descend.  Before him stand
Always a num'rous throng; and in his turn
Each one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears
His fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl'd.

"O thou! who to this residence of woe
Approachest?"  when he saw me coming, cried
Minos, relinquishing his dread employ,
"Look how thou enter here; beware in whom
Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad
Deceive thee to thy harm."  To him my guide:
"Wherefore exclaimest?  Hinder not his way
By destiny appointed; so 'tis will'd
Where will and power are one.  Ask thou no more."

Now 'gin the rueful wailings to be heard.
Now am I come where many a plaining voice
Smites on mine ear.  Into a place I came
Where light was silent all.  Bellowing there groan'd
A noise as of a sea in tempest torn
By warring winds.  The stormy blast of hell
With restless fury drives the spirits on
Whirl'd round and dash'd amain with sore annoy.
When they arrive before the ruinous sweep,
There shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans,
And blasphemies 'gainst the good Power in heaven.

I understood that to this torment sad
The carnal sinners are condemn'd, in whom
Reason by lust is sway'd.  As in large troops
And multitudinous, when winter reigns,
The starlings on their wings are borne abroad;
So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls.
On this side and on that, above, below,
It drives them: hope of rest to solace them
Is none, nor e'en of milder pang.  As cranes,
Chanting their dol'rous notes, traverse the sky,
Stretch'd out in long array: so I beheld
Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on
By their dire doom.  Then I: "Instructor! who
Are these, by the black air so scourg'd?"—"The first
'Mong those, of whom thou question'st," he replied,
"O'er many tongues was empress.  She in vice
Of luxury was so shameless, that she made
Liking be lawful by promulg'd decree,
To clear the blame she had herself incurr'd.
This is Semiramis, of whom 'tis writ,
That she succeeded Ninus her espous'd;
And held the land, which now the Soldan rules.
The next in amorous fury slew herself,
And to Sicheus' ashes broke her faith:
Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen."

There mark'd I Helen, for whose sake so long
The time was fraught with evil; there the great
Achilles, who with love fought to the end.
Paris I saw, and Tristan; and beside
A thousand more he show'd me, and by name
Pointed them out, whom love bereav'd of life.

When I had heard my sage instructor name
Those dames and knights of antique days, o'erpower'd
By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind
Was lost; and I began: "Bard! willingly
I would address those two together coming,
Which seem so light before the wind."  He thus:
"Note thou, when nearer they to us approach.
 that troop, where Dido ranks,
They through the ill air speeding; with such force
My cry prevail'd by strong affection urg'd.

"O gracious creature and benign! who go'st
Visiting, through this element obscure,
Us, who the world with bloody stain imbru'd;
If for a friend the King of all we own'd,
Our pray'r to him should for thy peace arise,
Since thou hast pity on our evil plight.
Of whatsoe'er to hear or to discourse
It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that
Freely with thee discourse, while e'er the wind,
As now, is mute.  The land, that gave me birth,
Is situate on the coast, where Po descends
To rest in ocean with his sequent streams.

"Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,
Entangled him by that fair form, from me
Ta'en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still:
Love, that denial takes from none belov'd,
Caught me with pleasing him so passing well,
That, as thou see'st, he yet deserts me not.


"AH me! O Satan! Satan!" loud exclaim'd
Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:
And the kind sage, whom no event surpris'd,
To comfort me thus spake: "Let not thy fear
Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none
To hinder down this rock thy safe descent."
Then to that sworn lip turning, "Peace!"  he cried,


Off the coast of Mexico, the ship of shark fin smuggler Carlos Santiago is caught in a cyclone, interrupting his meeting with a potential buyer. A tornado throws swarms of sharks onto the boat, killing all aboard.

The cyclone soon hits Los Angeles, flooding the city with shark-infested seawater. Bar owner and surfer Fin sets out with his friends, Baz, Nova, and George, to rescue his estranged wife, April, and their teenage daughter, Claudia, after the bar and boardwalk are destroyed by the flooding. While heading to April's home, the group stops on a freeway to save people as flooding causes sharks to attack. George is killed and the group learns of a tornado warning. They arrive at April's house just before the first floor is flooded and shark-infested. Collin, April's boyfriend, is eaten by sharks, but the rest of the group escapes unharmed from the house, which gets hit by a huge wave causing it to collapse.

As they travel, the group comes across a school bus trapped in the floodwaters and surrounded by sharks. Fin stops to save the children and bus driver by rappelling down to the bus from a bridge. Afterward, the bus driver is killed by a letter in the Hollywood Sign. While Nova is driving the car, a shark lands on top of the car and rips the roof off. Fin's hand is cut and the group abandons the car before it explodes. They steal another car and meet up with Fin and April's son Matt, who is found taking shelter at his flight school. Three tornadoes develop and absorb the floodwater, turning into shark-filled "sharknados". The group borrow equipment from nearby storage and Matt and Nova become attracted to each other. Matt and Nova decide to stop the threat of the incoming sharknados by tossing bombs into them from a helicopter. Two are destroyed, but they are unable to stop the third one.

As Nova fights off a shark that had latched onto the helicopter, she falls out of the helicopter and directly into another shark's mouth. Matt is heartbroken. Baz is also lost in the storm along with Matt's friends Bobby and Luellyn. Ultimately, Fin destroys the last sharknado with a bomb attached to his car and the sharks begin to plummet toward the ground. One falling shark flies directly toward the remaining members of the group. Fin jumps into its mouth with a chainsaw and cuts his way out. He emerges carrying an unconscious but otherwise unharmed Nova. Matt is reunited with Nova, and Fin gets back together with April.

THE TRUTH ABOUT MY SEX-LIFE
"S"FEBRUARY 13, 2012406 VIEWS
FEATURED ARTICLESMIND/BODYSEX0 COMMENTS406 VIEWS 0
I know this site is about being better after 50. But here’s the truth: I’m not convinced sex is better after 50. Sure, we don’t have the kids to worry about, and yes, it’s nice to be just us, but things – at least in my bedroom – have gotten quite routine and boring. There I said it.

After 25 years together, we’ve lost the spark.

When I see my young adult children all lovey-dovey with their boyfriends, I’m actually a tad jealous. How nice, I think, to melt into each other’s arms, get goose bumps simply by holding hands, and enjoy the anticipation of long and slow makeup sessions (though of course I try not to think of my girls in these positions).

There’s definitely something to be said for young love.

And something to be said for “old love.”

Yes, we fit into each other’s bodies perfectly. And yes, I know every hair on his chest and crease in his neck and how long it will take him to get things going.  But do I get as excited and revved up as I did in the old days?

No.

When I talk to my girlfriends, they seem to be in the same camp. Which makes me feel a bit better. Though, in reality, it’s difficult to get hard truths (no pun intended).  According to some research I’ve read, married couples over 50 have sex once or twice a week. Yet another study puts that number at closer to once or twice a month. Still another goes on to report that couples with higher levels of marital satisfaction have higher frequencies of sex.  Does that mean I’m not happy? I don’t think so. Can’t I just be tired? Or as one reader on a website wrote in, “dryer than the Sahara?”

True, as we age we lose our libidos, and yes, menopause can sometimes make sex uncomfortable. It’s also true we often have to “work harder” to make our spouses more pliable which frankly, can get tiring (see excuse #1 above). And yes, there’s a dryness issue. But all of this can be worked out.

sponning pupsIf there’s one thing I know in my 50-plus years on earth it’s this: Men are controlled by their organs. They want sex. Would have it all the time, if they could, even with a fever or a bad back or anything else they may have complained about earlier in the day. And while their medications may slow them down, they still crave it, desire it, aspire for it– and want you to be interested too.

Being a certain age, we know the things we’re supposed to do. Date nights. Hotel overnights. Lubricate. Communicate. I’d add to that: Check your Vitamin D levels, get the rest you need, watch some hot movies, and forget about what everyone else is doing.

I’m fine with our routine, “boring” as it may be. I like the comfort. And I like that my husband doesn’t complain when I crawl into bed with my flannel pj’s and my hair piled high in a messy ponytail, the grease of my heavy moisturizing night cream slathered on my face.  I like that he knows my jiggling body and enjoys it for what it is (or rather, what it’s become). And I love snuggling – though often that leads to you know what (at least in his mind and so I have to comply). But mostly I love that after 25 years we have a solid marriage, meaning I can tell him to leave me alone when I’m really tired and know when I have to “give in” to make him happy (it always works in getting him to fix a leaky faucet the next day or that weird light in the basement). And while I’ll admit it’s interesting to hear about other people’s sex lives, at the end of the day I really don’t care. Just like “they” say 50 is the new 30 – it’s not. So why should I believe the hype when “they” say sex post 50 is “the best ever?”

It’s your life. What goes on between the sheets should stay there.
Where do farts come from, and what happens if you hold it in? Does everybody fart – and what about animals?

Everybody burps and farts around 2.5 litres of gas per day, which comes from the air we breathe, the drinks we quaff and the bacteria in our digestive system. Our bodies get rid of this excess gas via the mouth and anus. You may not even notice yourself passing gas – it can be very small quantities, and sometimes doesn't smell at all.

Unlike in cows, methane is not a major constituent of our farts. So if someone sets a fart alight, it’s usually hydrogen gas that’s burning.

While farting is completely normal, if you start to fart more than normal, if can be the result of an underlying medical condition.

Why do we fart?
We fart because there is gas in our intestines that we need to get out.

A small amount of swallowed air makes it into the intestines, but most of the gas there is produced by the bacteria that help to digest our food. This gas is expelled by burping and farting.

The gas is mainly hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The smell comes from sulphur compounds that are only present in trace amounts.

The nerve endings in your anus allow you to distinguish between a build-up of gas and a solid stool, so you can pass wind safely.

Does everybody fart?
Without exception. Gas ends up in the large intestine from air that is swallowed and from the action of the bacteria that live there. It is mostly nitrogen and carbon dioxide with some hydrogen and methane mixed in, with tiny amounts of skatole, indole, methanethiol, hydrogen sulfide and dimethyl sulfide to give it a stinky smell.

Everyone farts but some people take enough care with the release that they are rarely caught out. – Hannah Ashworth

Dr Michael Mosley: The Mediterranean diet is great for your gut (even if it makes you fart)
A Quiet Place Part II: Could the characters really hold their farts in for that long?
Why do I fart so much?
It's normal for some people to fart more than others. According to the NHS, the average person farts between 5 and 15 times a day. However, there are a few conditions that can cause you to fart more than normal.

Farting is a symptom of both coeliac disease and lactose intolerance. As well as eating foods that are difficult for you to digest, excessive flatulence can be caused by constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, indigestion and gastroenteritis. It can also be a side effect of some medications.

If you're concerned about your farting, visit your GP.

If you hold in a fart, where does it go?

It stays right there! If you suppress a fart, it actually just seeps out more quietly, or you might be able to hang on until the next time you are on the toilet. But sooner or later, that fart is coming out! – Luis Villazon

What foods make you fart?
Beans, beans, they're good for your heart. The more you eat, the more you fart... or so the poem says. But why do beans make you fart, exactly?

Beans, like many other foods, contain plenty of soluble fibre. While this is great for your health, it can also make you fart – soluble fibres are fermented in the colon, rather than being digested in the intestines. This produces gas, which becomes a fart.

Other fart-inducing foods include pulses, such as lentils and peas, brassicas including cabbages and broccoli, onions, prunes and apples.

Do animals fart?
So, all humans fart – but does that mean all animals do, too? Read on to find out which are flatulent fiends and which are silent but deadly.

Do rabbits fart?
Yes. Rabbits are described as non-ruminant herbivores, which means that while their diet consists of plant matter such as grass, flowers, as well as twigs, they do not have a specialised stomach to digest plant material. Instead, they rely on microorganisms (bacteria and protists) within their caecum (a pouch in their large intestine: you have one too) to extract nutrients from their cellulose-based diet.

Since their food is initially digested in their large intestine, in order to get the most nutrition out of their food rabbits also reingest their cecotropes, which are soft faeces consisting of the fermented plant material.

Unsurprisingly, both the rabbit’s slightly disgusting diet and their digestive system provide the perfect recipe for farts. Rabbits not only can and do fart, but they need to fart. Stress, dehydration and a diet that is low in fibre but high in carbohydrates and sugar can lead to a build-up of gas within their intestines, which is known as intestinal stasis.

While farts are often humorous, this is no laughing matter for rabbits, as this gas build-up is extremely painful and can become fatal very quickly unless properly released, sometimes requiring medical intervention. – Dani Rabaiotti

Do spiders fart?
Nobody knows! Spider flatulence is an oddly understudied topic in scientific literature, but we can look to their digestive system for some clues. Spiders do the vast majority of digestion outside their body, injecting their prey with venom from their fangs before ejecting sputum, full of digestive enzymes, from their mouths, through the fang holes and into the body of their prey.

They then wait whilst the digestive juices break down tissues inside the exoskeleton or, in some cases, skin of their prey. Spiders will then suck up the liquidy goodness into their mouths and stomachs, then they regurgitate it and eat it again.

This happens a number of times, as spider digestive systems can only handle liquids – which means no lumps! It would seem likely that spiders ingest air during this process – one of the key elements needed for a fart. Once they have extracted all the nutrients, in an organ called the ceaca, the food passes to the stercoral sac, where the moisture is extracted before anything left over is excreted through the anus as waste.

Since the stercoral sac contains bacteria, which helps break down the spider’s food, it seems likely that gas is produced during this process, and therefore there is certainly the possibility that spiders do fart. No work has been done to verify this to date, however, so the truth remains a mystery until urgently needed research funding is allocated. – Dani Rabaiotti

Do birds fart?
Birds have an anus, and so technically could fart, but to date there’s been no official evidence that they do. One theory is that they don’t need to fart like humans and other mammals because they have a faster rate of digestion – their food simply doesn’t spend long enough in their short gastrointestinal tracts to ferment and form gas.

Another theory is that birds’ guts don’t contain the same gas-forming bacteria as mammals. It’s also possible that ornithologists have missed bird farts because they leak out passively rather than in one eruption, or birds could be burping to release unwanted gas instead. – Charlotte Corney

Did dinosaurs fart?
Yes! Just like dogs, some insects, and even millipedes, dinosaurs undoubtedly would have passed gas.

Not only did Brontosaurus and Triceratops make wind, but they would have made a lot of it. So much, in fact, that it affected the entire Earth and its climate. One study found that dinosaurs’ ‘emissions’ were an important factor in keeping the planet warm and moist during the Mesozoic Era (250 to 65 million years ago).

Similarly, farts and burps shape our modern climate: emissions from livestock account for more than 10 per cent of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions today
Farts. This isn’t exactly a topic most people discuss over lunch with friends, but it’s a perfectly normal, healthy part of daily life. People pass gas, or fart, anywhere between eight to 14 times a day.1 Some people fart more—up to 25 times a day is considered normal.1

If you notice that you’re farting more than usual, or having abdominal pain with your gas, see your healthcare provider.

In this article, you’ll read about why we fart, what a fart is, what causes flatulence, and how to manage it.

What Is a Fart?
A fart is when you pass gas through your anus. This gas has built up in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The gas has to escape, and when it is pushed out or released by your anus, it’s called a fart. It can also be called flatus or flatulence.

Causes
Gas usually enters the GI tract when you swallow air, and when the intestinal bacteria break down food, especially undigested carbohydrates.1 Swallowing air is normal and happens when you eat and drink, but more air can be swallowed if you chew gum, drink carbonated drinks, smoke, or eat and drink too fast.1 When bacteria break down carbohydrates, gas is a byproduct.

There are also health conditions that can cause gas. These can include:1

IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and other functional GI disorders are disorders associated with how your brain and gut work together and can affect how gas moves through your body
Issues with carbohydrate digestion, including lactose intolerance or dietary fructose intolerance
Small intestinal bacteria overgrowth (bacteria produce extra gas)
Other ailments, such as celiac disease, diarrhea, Gastroparesis, or obstruction or blockage of the digestive tract
If you are noticing a change in your farting habits or gas production, talk with your healthcare provider.

Constant Gas
Constant gas is not typical. Sometimes there are health conditions that cause more gas than usual. If you have constant gas all of a sudden, first check your diet to see if your eating or drinking habits have changed recently.

Treatment
If you’ve been diagnosed with a medical condition that involves excess gas, your healthcare team will go over your treatment options.

Simethicone products are marketed as treatment for excess gas but their efficacy has yet to be determined; the same with charcoal tablets.2 Weak abdominal muscles may benefit from abdominal-tensing exercises, but this is difficult in older individuals. Antibiotics can help with bacterial overgrowth, but your healthcare provider will have to do an evaluation to see if this is the cause.2
Prevention
If you do not have a medical condition that explains your excess gas and you're looking for help to reduce the amount of gas you have, things you can do include:2

Stop drinking carbonated drinks like soda and beer
Avoid foods like broccoli, cabbage, beans, bran, and cauliflower
Avoid milk and dairy
Do not suck on hard candies or chew gum
Avoid sugar-free gum and candies because these contain sorbitol or mannitol, both of which can cause gas
Try to reduce or eliminate only one thing at a time to see which one is causing the issue. If nothing provides relief, see your healthcare provider or a nutritionist about which foods tend to give you more gas symptoms. They can work with you to create a diet that minimizes gas and accompanying symptoms like pain and/or bloating.

Our Beliefs

The Bible
The Bible is the Word of God, supernaturally inspired, inerrant, without contradiction, and preserved by God. It is absolute in its authority and complete in its revelation.

 

God
There is one God, eternally existent, creator of the heaven and earth who exists in three persons - Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. God created the universe in six literal days.

 

Jesus Christ
The Lord Jesus Christ is fully God who took on flesh and dwelt on earth. He was born of a virgin. He was sinlessly perfect and gave Himself as a substitutionary sacrifice by shedding His blood and dying on the cross. He then came back bodily from the dead. He later ascended to heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father and will one day return to reign on earth.

 

The Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit is the Third Person of the Trinity, the Agent of conviction, regeneration, indwelling, baptism, sanctification, and illumination of all who are born into God’s family through Jesus Christ. We are opposed to the charismatic movement and its tongues and other sign manifestations.

 

Angels
We believe that the angels are created beings. They are by nature spirit beings possessing all the characteristics of personality (intellect, emotion, and will) and are superior to man in power.  Their purposes of existence are to praise and glorify God, to serve as ministering spirits on behalf of believers, and to serve God in whatever ways He desires.

 

Man
Each member of the human race is fallen, sinful, and is lost and is in need of salvation. A new birth through regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential for the salvation of man.

 

Salvation
Man is saved by undeserved mercy through faith and nothing of man enters into his salvation; it is a free gift. Man's efforts, regardless of how good or well intended, before or after salvation, have nothing to do with it. Salvation is by the finished work of Christ and nothing can be added to it.

 

Sin
We believe that sin is anything that is opposed to holiness and everything that is contrary to the character and will of God.  Because of Adam's sin and the resulting depravity of all mankind, no one has merit before God or capacity for achieving any merit in his state of separation from God.  Every person, therefore, automatically stands guilty before God, with the penalty being eternal separation from God, and the only hope being regeneration provided by God Himself.

 

Eternal Security
Every true child of God possesses eternal life and is, therefore, safe and secure for all eternity, being justified by faith, sanctified by God, and sealed by the Holy Spirit; he cannot lose his salvation. However, a Christian can through sin, lose his fellowship, joy, power, testimony, and reward, and incur the Father's chastisement. Relationship is eternal, being established by the new birth; fellowship, however, is dependent upon obedience.

 

The Church
We believe that the invisible church is an organism composed of all saved people from the time of Pentecost to the rapture, that it is a New Testament institution unknown to the Old Testament prophets, and that it is separate and distinct from Israel, composed of both Jews and Gentiles.  Believers become part of this institution through the baptism of the Holy Spirit, whereby He places them into the body of Christ at the moment of salvation.

 

Future Events
We believe in the imminent, pre-tribulational return of Jesus Christ for all believers. This Rapture of the saints will be followed by a seven-year period of Tribulation, after which Christ will return in glory to judge the world and set up His millennial reign on earth.

Upon its release, Van Halen reached No. 19 on the Billboard pop music charts, one of rock's most commercially successful debuts.[30] It was highly regarded as both a heavy metal and hard rock album.[31] The album included songs now regarded as Van Halen classics, like "Runnin' with the Devil" and the guitar solo "Eruption", which showcased Eddie's use of a technique known as "finger-tapping". The band toured for 9 months more, opening for Black Sabbath and establishing a reputation for their performances.[32] The band's chemistry was based on Eddie Van Halen's guitar technique and David Lee Roth's charisma. The band returned to the studio for 2 weeks, in late 1978, to record Van Halen II, a 1979 LP similar in style to their debut. This record yielded the band's first hit single, "Dance the Night Away", which peaked at 15 on BB Hot 100.

Over the next four years, the band toured non stop, never taking more than 2 weeks to record an album. Their Women and Children First album was released in 1980, and further cemented Van Halen's platinum-selling status to Warner Bros. It yielded two hit singles And the Cradle Will Rock... and Everybody Wants Some!!. For the first time, an amplified Wurlitzer electric piano was used to complement Ed's guitar.


Van Halen in 1981
In 1981, during the recording of the Fair Warning album, artistic tensions rose.[clarification needed] Eddie's desire for darker, more complex songs in minor keys was at odds with Roth's pop tastes and style. Nonetheless, Roth and veteran Warner Bros rock producer Ted Templeman acquiesced to Eddie's wishes on this album. Doug Messenger recalls how Ed and (engineer) Don Landee rerecorded the Unchained solo hours after Ted "stormed out of" the studio. This darker album only reached platinum status after $250,000 of payola pushed it up nationwide from 400k copies.[32]

Planning to release a cover single, then take a hiatus, Roth and Ed easily agreed upon a remake of the 1960s Roy Orbison classic Oh, Pretty Woman, which peaked at 12 on BB Top 100. Pretty Woman's comical video helped its immediate success, but was also banned by MTV. However, due to much pressure from Warner Bros. the hiatus was canceled and the Diver Down LP was squeezed out, again, within 2 weeks time.[32] Roth's preference for pop covers prevailed this time and with Ed's synthesizer and guitar riffs Diver Down charted much better. The band then earned a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for the highest-paid single appearance of a band: $1.5 million for a 90-minute set at Steve Wozniak's 1983 US Festival.[33] A show that both Noel Monk and Doug Messenger considered artistically, a performance disaster, Roth being imbibed on cocaine to the point of forgetting lyrics.[32] Despite this return to form, Roth and Eddie's differences continued, and this caused friction with other band members. Billy Sheehan, after his band Talas completed a tour with Van Halen, claims he was approached by Eddie to replace Michael Anthony, the reasons for this were never completely clear to Sheehan as nothing came of it.[34] During this time, Eddie contributed the score and instrumental songs to the movie The Wild Life, starring Eric Stoltz.[35] The score was laden with drum machine and hinted at sounds and riffs that would come with their next two albums, 1984 and 5150.

1984 (released on January 9, 1984) was a commercial success, going five-times platinum after a year of release.[36] Recorded at Eddie's newly built 5150 Studios, the album featured keyboards, which had only been used sporadically on previous albums. The lead single, "Jump", featured a synthesizer hook and anthemic lyrics inspired by news coverage of a suicidal jumper. It became the band's first and only No. 1 pop hit with Roth, garnering them a Grammy nomination.[37]

Sample of "Jump", the lead single from the band's sixth album, 1984. Centered around a synthesizer hook instead of the band's trademark guitar sound, and featuring anthemic lyrics, the song became the band's most commercially successful single.[38]

Other singles included "Panama" (No. 13 U.S.), "I'll Wait" (also No. 13 U.S.), and "Hot for Teacher". Three of the songs had popular music videos on MTV. 1984 was praised by critics[39][40][41] and fans alike,[42][43] peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard charts behind Michael Jackson's Thriller.

Following the 1984 Tour, Roth decided to quit and form a new band. Group members have given different reasons for the split, but all were firmly rooted in control of the band's sound, artistic direction, singles released and pace. Roth was concerned about Eddie playing music outside of Van Halen. Roth was also launching a successful solo career with two hit cover songs off his Crazy from the Heat EP, a remake of the Beach Boys' classic "California Girls" (#3 U.S.) and a pairing of the classic Al Jolson standard "Just a Gigolo" and "I Ain't Got Nobody"(#12 U.S.), which had previously been paired together by Louis Prima. Roth was also offered a $20-million film deal for a script titled Crazy from the Heat. Roth hoped Van Halen would contribute the soundtrack; however, the film deal fell through when CBS Pictures was reorganized in 1986.
The Hellbound Heart says the Cenobites are also known as "The Order of the Gash."[2] Cenobites were once human, having transformed to their current state in their pursuit of gratification.[3] Cenobites are so removed from their former humanity and so dedicated to exploring physical experience that they no longer distinguish between sensations of pleasure and pain. Humans who summon the Cenobites, either by accident or in hopes of experiencing pleasures unknown on Earth, are often taken to their home dimension and become "experiments" in discovering the limits of physical experience, resulting in torture for eternity.

The Cenobites vary in number, appearance, and motivations depending on the medium (film, comic book, etc.) in which they appear. The involvement of multiple parties in the production of Hellraiser films and comics (many eschewing the creative supervision of Clive Barker) has led to varying levels of consistency with respect to their philosophies and abilities; for instance, their powers were much reduced in the 1992 film Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth compared with the first two films.[4] The original novella and first two films indicate they are morally ambiguous ("angels to some, demons to others") but later films and comics depict them as often malicious and taking delight in causing harm. The only constants are that they take the form of ritually mutilated people with varying degrees of human characteristics, and that they can only reach Earth's reality when summoned through a schism in time and space, which is opened and closed using a puzzle box known as the Lament Configuration or, as described in the original story, the Lemarchand Configuration.

Frank Cotton is a sadomasochistic criminal selfishly devoted to sensual experience even if it harms others. Believing he has indulged in every pleasure the world can offer, Frank pursues rumours of the Lemarchand Configuration, a puzzle box said to open a "schism" or portal to an extradimensional realm of unfathomable pleasure ruled by beings called the Cenobites. In Düsseldorf, Frank obtains the box and returns with it to his deceased grandmother's home in England. Solving the box, he is confused and horrified when the Cenobites – horribly scarified creatures whose bodies have been modified to the point that they appear sexless and in constant pain – arrive. The Cenobites warn he cannot renege on their agreement once it is made, but Frank still eagerly accepts the offer of experiences he has never known before. With Frank as their newest "experiment", the Cenobites subject him to total sensory overload and he realises their devotion to sadomasochism is so extreme and their personalities so removed from humanity that they no longer differentiate between pain and pleasure and have no care to ever stop even if their subject no longer wishes the experience. Frank is taken to the Cenobite realm, a hellish dimension where he will be subjected to an eternity of torture.[4]

Sometime later, Frank's brother, Rory, moves into the home in England with his wife Julia. Unknown to Rory, Julia had an affair with Frank a week before their wedding and has lusted after him since. While in the attic, Rory accidentally cuts his hand and bleeds on the spot where Frank was taken by the Cenobites. The blood, mixed with semen Frank had left on the floor before he was taken, opens a dimensional schism. Frank returns, his body now reduced to a desiccated corpse by the Cenobites' experiments. Julia later finds him and promises to restore his body so he can truly live and they can be together.

While Rory works, Julia seduces men at bars and brings them to the attic where she murders them. Frank feeds on their bodies, causing his own to slowly regenerate. Kirsty, a friend of Rory's who has romantic feelings for him, suspects Julia is having an affair. Attempting to catch Julia in the act, she encounters Frank, who attempts to kill her. Kirsty grabs the puzzle box, using it as a weapon before fleeing. She collapses on the street from exhaustion and wakes up in a hospital later. While waiting, she solves the box and inadvertently summons a Cenobite. The Cenobite explains the box is called the Lemarchand Configuration and realizes Kirsty summoned it by accident, but then remarks this does not matter. The Cenobite intends to take Kirsty now that it is here, but she then reveals Frank is alive on Earth again. Though skeptical that one of their experiments could have escaped, the Cenobite is intrigued. It agrees that if Kirsty leads them to Frank and he confirms his identity, they will take him back and perhaps leave her alone.


Cover of Night Visions 3 (1986)
The Cenobite seems to vanish and Kirsty returns to the house. Rory and Julia claim they killed Frank but Kirsty realizes the man she is speaking to is Frank wearing Rory's skin. Another altercation ensues, during which Frank inadvertently kills Julia. Kirsty then baits Frank into admitting his true name out loud. The Cenobites appear, ensnare Frank and return him to their realm, telling Kirsty to leave. Downstairs, Kirsty sees Julia's disembodied head calling for help. The leader of the Cenobites, a being called the Engineer, then appears and seems to take away Julia as well before briefly bumping into Kirsty. After leaving the house, Kirsty realizes the Engineer gave her the puzzle box to watch over until another seeks it out.

Looking at the box's surface, Kirsty imagines she sees Julia and Frank's faces but not Rory's. She wonders if there are other puzzles that may unlock doors to a paradise where Rory resides, but laments that she may never find one and that broken hearts might be puzzles that cannot be solved
Watch the skies as hell comes riding in
On a horse of pale to name this wrath
Torturing worthless souls as this reign begins
This hand of doom is set to rule the world

A wilted faith in these times of regret
Sculpting death in madness obsessed

Words of this mayhem cast out loud
A timeless torture foretold in a sky of black
Torn souls from the mold of flesh and bone
Hordes of plague in this path of all decay

Obliterate the screams of the weak
Who needs a god when you've got Satan
No god to offer this forgiveness
No god to punish for these sins
Tormented for the prize of salvation
Broken loyalty to life after death

These dark thoughts of this revival
Answered by the prayers of this carnage
Confusion caused in the spread of horror
The answer to your nightmares has just begun

Forgotten praise of a savior from the rapture beyond the clouds
A burning fear of the wrongs that the slave has chosen

Cleansed in flame, purified through ash
These burning rites of the vengeful
The head of three faces, severed in confession
Ritual abuse to swarm the insects of famine

Endless weight of sufferance closing the source of breath
Battle call for the rise of genocide for the righteous believers
Unholy force to be summoned by the screams of slaughter
The wicked tongue of plague calling forth the death of god


2. The All-destroying

Crumbling stone faces, dismantle this praise
Rubbing ash of conquest, across faces of war

Self imploding flame of birth
Scorn and hate risen from ashes
Diving the divisions of hell
Dare to go where evil has no shame

Revolting the presence of question
Concealing this senseless bitter blood
A hope for this landscape of terror, for the demands of this retribution

Raped soul of conformity
Let the blood flow from these wrists
Transparent emotion of rage, as flesh tears in the fall of hope

Reap benefit of gratifying torture
Vast scape of crimson realms
Welcome this dread of unknowing
No higher vision shall curse my
Thoughts of devastation
Digested and forced
This carnivorous state

Of primitive killing
Unleash hell's wrath

Swallowed in blood and fire
Assume the birth rite of murder
Great genesis of reprisal
Spreading great wings of war

Taking the lives, of this resistance
To fuel the machine, with endless carnage

Prolong the expectation of faith in the jaws of fear
Satisfied in this excavation of the heavenly womb

Fed by flame, nourished by death
I'm eating the blood
Tearing meat with teeth and nails
The all-destroying
Devouring the hearts of the ancient ways
A machine for the will of Satan
Whose tongues bless in diabolic spite


3. Carving Out The Eyes Of God

Bastards of madness
Call out this prayer of vengeance
Speaking to enemies through these wounds of redemption
Tearing out their eyes with horror

Behold this chosen new devise
As the silence pleads this forgiveness
A senseless begging for absolution
Upon this entrance into oblivion

This fallen angel of defiance, destitute to isolation
Hold tight to liberation, in the form of reprisal
Project of this restored frame, in these pain filled alterations
This new threat of changing life restless in this completion

Powerless you crawl like pigs
Soon to be slaughtered
Suckling to a faith that you avidly hoped would save you all
These offerings will bring us our justice.
For these years of diluted lies
The answers to our freedom
The answer to the death of gods

These hands held into the sky so the dark
Winds can taste the blood of murder

As the blackest hearts obey thoughts of evil
Deathlorn rites, endure the lust for revenge
Surrender the state of embracement and release
This life from the dark interiors
Discomfort of this assisted torment is given in these regards

A scourge of awakening
Prisoned in the rites of blood
Bestowed with ancient plagues, we will forge a disease
Of rape upon your ideals
Within this lifeblood we will find the truths as blades
Slice open their necks
The answers to our freedom
The answer to the death of gods

Once reconstructed the swarm will digest
The souls of this imperfection
Sterilizing faith bringer has discharged
This assembly of this damnation

Burden me with your weak
Curse me with your sick
In blood filled walls I lie confined
Carving out the blind eye of god


4. Shadow Of A Rising Knife

Blackest soul of this deception,
Instinctive downfall in the hands of justice
Deny these prayers of the feeble,
This mental hammer of a new abomination

Delusional pain of resentment
Phantom senses of this stolen purpose
Unknown birth without a reactive sense
This admiration of evil ways
Unite the adverse outlook of this faith
Assassins of this justice to be ripped of skin
Self-obsessed moral arrogance
Tyrant goals of these chained ideas
Committing acts of evil for the name of good

Fury that burned like the desert sands
I will not acknowledge this faith of lies
Beckoning this call for murderous change
Burrowing through these layers to the surface

Stolen words that have been forged
From the neglected myths of knowledge
Stench of fear from the living reeks of cowardice
Casting this treason of life
Into the frozen word of loneliness
These conquests of hatred are a testimony
A world in which man spawned

Great praise that beings the rise tragic
Towering the skies in this complete wreckage
Cast into bowels of the abyss
Mankind created for this penance
Corruption lays so close to the voice that forces it

Black bleeding eyes of the pale horse
Entrance into the passage of war
These nails that were forged into the cross
Embracing of thoughts swallowed by the dark

Never kneel before this crucified image, never crawl before these enslaved intentions
These cultural evils are overturned for the rise of resenting wars
Strike out with self loathing infection, denying the cause for this blind redemption

Lying words from broken truths
Extract the resistance of change
Historic beliefs of this leverage
Begin this tragedy of existence

Spoken words of this final stand
Prophets will preach of laws that have damned the birth of man
These fears are entombed in books, that
Portray a tale of this revelation
Seeding the implements of annihilation
These worn analogies of the dying
Strangled thoughts with hell's eternal fire
Handing over the self you deny


5. Provoking The Ritual Of Death

Understood in the start of all endings,
I've wandered so far from this discipline
Unease begins this climb to stellar thoughts,
Causing this descent into cavernous neglect

Carving these Egyptians into flesh, for this damned access into the void
A white haze covers this perception, release me into the layers of this demise
Open these channels of this self-murder,
The wish to deny the golden flight of skies
Transcend into breathless expiration, upon the layers of this earthly prison

Prying apart the skeleton that is the cage to the soul,
Awaken from death as cage with teeth
Wreckage of emotion crumbled in this hateful
Obsession before this kiss of decay

Reborn without an emotional bond
To be cast into a depth of souls
Satisfied as i feed in cultural habit
Upon the buried trance of a savior

Unseeing i fall into starless rituals,
In this defiance the decay is born
Growling hunger of eternal rest,
Spreading like a virus of ravenous wolves

Absolute in confines of breathless domains,
Peeling off this skin to shed this essence of shame
Exposing the truths behind this eminent return
That has been bred in burning earth

Without worth i climb
Lost to this darkness, emerging from black
Hallowing these souls that have defied this cryptic heart of wrath

All will be burnt
All will be lost
As this veil of blood will pour from the skies
Washed of all that is pure

Be the tool that defiles
That carves the awareness from fragile minds
Burn out the sky
Black out my eyes
Unwrought vision for this sick design

Destroyed the emotion of the heart to
Conquer this place of death


6. In Legions, I Am Wars Of Wrath

The bellows breath
Fueling the fire of wrath
spoken in a tongue only embraced by cast out gods

Thrown from the heavens like discharged light
A thousand year exile beneath this sulfur cage

Prying open the cranial vault for this source of passage
Utter the incantations of this vile onslaught
Spinning webs up to the stars for insurrection
Inviting this disaster to the gardens of Eden

Sink these teeth of blasphemy into the skin of faith
As weakness devours this broken intellect

White eyes grasp white fires and the black shadow of death
Reborn through frenzied tasks to sacrifice the hung words of Judas
Upon a throne of suffering with visions of hateful awakening
Permit these words of hell to be written among the upper regions

Lies! Lies!
Swallowing the poison in which to despise
Journey through this mental torture
Filled with hate in veins of this desire

Rise! Rise!
Through this inquisition of the storm of bane
Sorcery of intellect to enslave these virgin minds

These godless wounds shall bring the skies below the earth
Reaching forth from the judgment in his wicked defiance
In legions, i am the words of spite and hate
In legions, i am the wars of wrath

Tranquil curses in winded swears
These solid wishes of creations end

Forewarn in anthem of whispered deaths
Transcendence defines this sadistic life

In rage i become the virus, revenge is what is to be bled
Exhibit of morbid reactions that pave roads
With the slain remains of the dead
Resurface the bones from these mental
Chambers of this secret abyss
Heaving the words that will open
The gates of this vengeance


7. Reckoning Of The Soul Made Godless

memory of these blood stained faces,
in the darkest corners of primeval wisdom
she lays awaiting the masters of faith

mistreated actions take form, in an outlet to avenge this rage
drowning within the spiral of this hellish plane

a naked body layered with sigils of this summoning
these preaching altars transformed for consecration

like blood and fire
in the sacred chalice of Satan
i hail the blood stained horns
the goat of a thousand young

clandestine episode of inflicting torture,
on the self to culminate the powers of evil
an urge to take lives in these sadistic ways

reflection of horrific gaze
frozen with blurred visions
trembled lips beg in whispers
to represent the force of this offering

convert the virgin essence,
in offers of rape to the black goat
sanctified gestures of the perverse
attained in the source of anointing the god of fire

my name is spoken
echoing through the void

disciples of the damned
march into the fires

treacherous disciples
that brand the names of hell across virgin skin
forcing a trauma that induces this demonic hallucination

bleeding soul of the virgin whore
swallowed in the storms of flesh
a rising dawn of cruelty
awaken the impure

perception of the deviant, to the judges of mankind
slashing her wrists and arms, in hell their hearts lie

this proof of devotion
it had death's face
anticipate the cry of a hundred prayers for the release of pain

this eve of lucid conjuring
defiled notion of praise
fatten the beast with her flesh
her screams are unheard, except for the dead

adorn this whore of god with horns
screaming fury of eternal escape
conceptual journey to seek the birth of evil

arouse her fury in various states of amputation
crawling epidemic in quiet confines,
this falsified concubine of the heavens


8. This Passing Into The Power Of Demons

the eyes of this disgorged life, their faces are scared with lies
scratched marks on the walls in place of words
washed out, condemned, unearth this relic of the lecher
contorted spasm of demonic control, cold-blooded, impassive

hesitant in this disaster
fear gaps this subconscious plane
heavy breathing in final words
comprised in fragments of suicide

keeper of dead souls in the scythe of passing,
tormentor of self misery, a moment of weakness
carrier of the secret to annihilate the universe of
all that was living, deceiver of lifeless entrance to the beyond

crafted massacre from the undivine
a nomad of accursed paths
spitting poison from distorted tongues
this guardian of the cursed

chanting these words of possession,
calling to the burnt kingdoms
these ashen angels with the
horns of these superior demons

loss of faith bleeds from sliced wrists
wretched thought of this self intervention
sinful tongue will act as the spawn
for the words of this incantation

holding innocence as a caged animal to be
absent for recover in a later cause
heavy breathing in hellish attack,
god of heaven holds no ground in this place of black
sympathy dies in this immortal state, forcing the divine into killing their own
rise from the remains of this revived pandemonium

this face of evil covered in prolific tunes
a ceremony of these inverted rites
hate enduced fever of heavenly domains
inflicted rage from this evil spirit

secured in this cleanse, of transient minds
crumbling savage esponse, sanction is questioned

sensory degeneration, of positive emotion
upon the return, the rise of demons
endless suffering, prevails the host
ingesting this saga, from this place of cold


9. Razor Flesh Devoured

stealing souls for an urge that was kept a secret
fade in this memory, as these curses exit lips
digesting the power of dead space filled with betrayal
this evolution has passed down these genetics of evil

this message woes, ripped of emotion
conspiracy of poison, the target of bloodlust
black veiled whisperers, touched by the wicked
grey twilight of this might, a return from hell

as the bloodstained vision engulfs this purpose
awaken in the eclipse of self consuming rebirth
peeling back the skin of flame to rise up from this fire
these layers of apocalypse cover the sky in hatred

memories washed away in corridors lined with decay
demands by oblivious parasites of cradled fear
fluids drained in this task of a souls devourment
not a ray of light that breathes in this lack of hope

unleash the morbid, hear the call of wounds
this misfortune rules with a plague of rot
executing ritual mutilations of tradition
personal damage of bitter movements in staggered thought

scarification of entrance to this chaos
swine of forever, butchering the ageless
suffocate them with this fire
in strikes of rage flesh is torn by thorns that crown kings

effigy of a frozen vision severed of limbs, cast from the bone of angels
distinct venomous behavior, placed on this pedestal of the revealing terror

this evocation of wrath
these words that will take all life
a mouthful of revenge
choke on the virus spreading within, soaring deeper into the solar burn

entwined in the lateral movement above,
flesh covered grounds of massacre
only the most deviant of these supplicants,
will have forged the new worlds vision


10. To Mourn And Forever Wander Through Forgotten Doorways

Screaming chasm into these emptied voids
Senses aroused by the undoing of creation
Weapons of these vengeful arrangements
To coincide with this mass fall of imperium

Immense columns holding up the heavens
Collapsing from the might of the choirs below
Burrowing hallucination from the infested carrion
In this apocalypse for the millennium of the sun

Visualize the final stance of promise as blood pours out of the stars
A decay that serves as the portal into the gates of the great ancients
Tides of this distinct neglect awaken those who left behind the pride of liberation
Eating their own pulsing hearts in punishment
I am he as you are he as you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying
Sitting on a corn flake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation T-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long
I am the egg man
They are the egg men
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob
Mister City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down
I am the egg man
They are the egg men
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob
Sitting in an English garden
Waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come you get a tan
From standing in the English rain
I am the egg man (now good sir)
They are the egg men (a poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob, goo goo goo g'joob (good pity)
Expert, texpert choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you (ho ho ho, hee hee hee, hah hah hah)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snide
I'm crying
Semolina Pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allen Poe
And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.

5Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.

6And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.

7And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.

8And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.

9Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.

10As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.

11Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.

12And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.

13As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.

14And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.

15Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.

16The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.

17When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.

18As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.

19And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.

20Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

21When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

22And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.

23And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.

24And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.

25And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.

26And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.

27And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.

28As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
feces, also spelled faeces, also called excrement, solid bodily waste discharged from the large intestine through the anus during defecation. Feces are normally removed from the body one or two times a day. About 100 to 250 grams (3 to 8 ounces) of feces are excreted by a human adult daily.

Normally, feces are made up of 75 percent water and 25 percent solid matter. About 30 percent of the solid matter consists of dead bacteria; about 30 percent consists of indigestible food matter such as cellulose; 10 to 20 percent is cholesterol and other fats; 10 to 20 percent is inorganic substances such as calcium phosphate and iron phosphate; and 2 to 3 percent is protein. Cell debris shed from the mucous membrane of the intestinal tract also passes in the waste material, as do bile pigments (bilirubin) and dead leukocytes (white blood cells). The brown colour of feces is due to the action of bacteria on bilirubin, which is the end product of the breakdown of hemoglobin (red blood cells). The odour of feces is caused by the chemicals indole, skatole, hydrogen sulfide, and mercaptans, which are produced by bacterial action.

Many diseases and disorders can affect bowel function and produce abnormalities in the feces. Constipation is characterized by infrequent evacuations and the production of excessively hard and dry feces, while diarrhea results in frequent defecation and excessively soft, watery feces. Bleeding in the stomach or intestines may result in the passage of blood with the stool, which appears dark red, tarry, or black. Fatty or greasy stools usually indicate pancreatic or small-intestine afflictions. Typhoid, cholera, and amoebic dysentery are among diseases spread by the contamination of food with the feces of infected persons.
guano, accumulated excrement and remains of birds, bats, and seals, valued as fertilizer. Bird guano comes mainly from islands off the coasts of Peru, Baja (Lower) California, and Africa heavily populated by cormorants, pelicans, and gannets. Bat guano is found in caves throughout the world. Seal guano has accumulated to great depths on the Isla Lobos de Tierra and Islas Lobos de Afuera (Lobos Islands), off northwestern Peru. Bat and seal guano are lower in fertilizer value than bird guano, which contains about 11 to 16 percent nitrogen, 8 to 12 percent phosphoric acid, and 2 to 3 percent potash.
[1] And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.
[2] And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
[3] And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.
[4] And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.
[5] And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.
[6] And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
[7] And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.
[8] And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.
[9] And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:
[10] And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
[11] And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.
[12] And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;
[13] And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.
[14] And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
[15] And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;
[16] And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
[17] For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
